<h1 id="parentMessaging">Parent Messaging</h1>

<p>Parent Messaging is a powerful communications feature that enables schools to send messages to groups of parents or the entire school at one time through email, text messages, or voice messages. Create email and voice message templates for frequently sent messages including school closures, field trip information, or tuition information. You can also create and save recipient lists for groups that are contacted frequently such as the PTA, the school committee, or specific grade levels.</p>

<p>This chapter provides detailed information on creating emails, text messages, and voice messages for mass mailing.</p>

<h2 id="introparentmessaging">Introduction to Parent Messaging</h2>
<p>Parent Messaging is a powerful, highly customizable tool for communicating with parents and students quickly. The QuickSchools email, text messaging, and voice messaging features are integrated with the student database, making student and parent names, email addresses, and phone numbers available with a click of the mouse. Create groups of frequently contacted people, like the PTA, the debate team, or grade-specific students to quickly and easily add large numbers of recipients to your messages. To further streamline mass communications, save templates of your most frequently used communications so you do not have to repeatedly recreate the same messages.</p>




<h2 id="enabledisableparentmessaging">Enabling and Disabling Parent Messaging</h2>
<p>By default the Parent Messaging feature comes enabled. If your school does not need to use the Parent Messaging feature, you may turn the feature off.

Likewise, if the Parent Messaging option is not visible in the top menu bar, it is easily enabled for immediate use within your school.</p>

<p>Click <b>Features</b> at the top of the page to open the Features page.</p>

<p>A recipient list, also called a call list, is a saved group of parents and students who share a common interest, such as the PTA, the school committee, or the activities club.  Saved recipient lists can be used to quickly address your email, text, and voice messages. A recipient list can include individuals and specific grade levels, and it can also exclude specific students.</p>
