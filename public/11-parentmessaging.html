<h2>Country code handling</h2>

<p>All schools have a default country code. You can set this under the Features menu when configuring Mass Parent Messaging.<p>
<p>For example, schools in the US would set this to "+1", whereas schools in the UK would set this to  "+44".</p>

<p>When entering a phone number for a student, teacher or parent, you can choose whether or not to enter the country code.
It is only required if the phone number has a different country code.</p>

<p>When sending a text message or making a phone call to a number that doesn't have an explicit country code, 
QuickSchools will automatically append the default country code to the phone number.</p>
