<h2 id="accessingteachers">Accessing the Teachers Tab</h2>
<p>To access the teacher information tab from your login page, click on the <b>Teachers</b> link in the green 
bar at the top of the screen, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teachaccess.png" width="680" height="104" /></div>

<p>This will bring up the main Teachers page, on which you will see a list of all teachers in the school. If
you are accessing this page for the very first time, it will appear empty until you add teachers, and the screen will 
display this message:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teachersfirsttime.png" width="680" height="324" /></div>

Teachers may be added to the page in two ways: either manually, or by importing teacher records from an 
existing Excel file. Once some teachers have been added, the home page will include a list of those records, presented 
in alphabetical order:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/firstpage.png" width="680" height="327" /></div>

<p>Add buttons now appear directly above the list of teachers on the main page.</p>

<h2 id="addingteachers">Adding Teachers Manually</h2>

<p>To manually add a teacher, click the <b>Add Teacher</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/addteacherbutton.png" width="107" height="30" />). 
This will bring up an <b>Add Teachers</b> popup box 
that looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/addingteacher.png" width="567" height="268" /></div>

<p>Now you can enter the teacher's full name and email in the corresponding fields in the box. If you would like to sort 
the teachers by last name, be sure to enter them as [Last Name], [First Name] in the name field; otherwise they will be 
alphabetized by first name. Teachers can be automatically invited to join QuickSchools by checking the <b>Invite via Email</b>
 box. Click the red <b>Add Teacher</b> button 
 (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/redaddteacherbutton.png" width="111" height="30" />) to 
 complete the addition of the teacher record to the Teachers page.</p>

<h2 id="importingteachers">Importing Teacher Records from Excel</h2>

<p>An efficient way to add large numbers of teachers to your QuickSchools account is to use the <b>Import</b>
feature. To do this you need to have your teacher data accessible in an Excel file, one with either an ".xls" or
".xlsx" extension. QuickSchools will automatically analyze your file and map commonly-named columns 
to the fields in a QuickSchools teacher record.</p>

<p>To proceed, click on the <b>Import</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/importteachbutton.png" width="131" height="30" />).
This will bring up a file selection screen, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/importscreen1.png" width="680" height="243" /></div>

<p>Once you select the .xls or .xlsx file containing your teacher data, you will see a second screen 
displaying each set of data from your file and the corresponding field it will be mapped to in the 
QuickSchools database:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/modifyimport.png" width="680" height="464" /></div>

<p>First, check to make sure that the file you have selected is correct. If not, click on the <b>Change</b> link and 
select the right one. Each field in the .xls or .xlsx file will be mapped to a corresponding field in 
the QuickSchools database. Again, if the choice given is not the best one, you can change it by selecting 
a different one from the drop-down menu. If you want to omit an entire column of data and prevent it from 
being mapped onto a QuickSchools field, place your mouse over the <b>Don't import this column</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/dontimportbutton.png" width="162" height="30" />) on the right and click it to prevent 
that data set from being uploaded.</p>

<p>When you have made all the necessary changes, scroll down to the bottom of the screen, which should look like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/importdatabutton.png" width="680" height="162" /></div>

<p>Now click the red button 
<b>Click here to import data</b> (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/redimportbutton.png" width="174" height="30" />) to initiate the
import. Depending on the size of your file, the process may take a few minutes, during which time you may see the 
following popup message box:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/processing1.png" width="322" height="397" /></div>

<p>After the import process is complete, your data will be added to your QuickSchools account!</p>

<h2 id="displayingteachers">Displaying and Managing Teacher Records</h2>

<p>Once you have entered or imported teacher record data into QuickSchools, your <b>Teachers</b> tab will 
list those teachers on the main page, <b>in alphabetical order by the first letter in the Name field.</b> This 
means that if you want them to be sorted by last name, you must enter the last name first, as shown here:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teacherpage.png" width="680" height="414" /></div>

<h3 id="teacherreversealpha">Displaying Teachers in Reverse Alphabetical Order</h3>

<p>It is easy to display teachers in reverse alphabetical order; click once on the dark green border labeled 
<b>Teacher</b> next to the white triangle and it will reverse to list them from "Z" to "A."</p>

<h3 id="deletingteachers">Deleting Teachers</h3>

<div class="left"><img src="images_ks_teachers/deletiondropdown.png" width="453" height="320" /></div>

<p>The checkboxes on the left-hand side of the <b>Teachers</b> screen can be used to select records for deletion. Use the dropdown menu at the top of the column to globally select all records or deselect all records on the page, or 
click manually on the ones you want, and then scroll down to <b>Delete</b> to delete the selected records. A confirmation 
popup box will appear, indicating that the deletion of a teacher will also delete subjects assigned to that teacher, and 
asking for permission to proceed:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/confirmdelete.png" width="680" height="286" /></div>

<p>To confirm deletion, click on the red <b>Delete Teachers</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/deleteteachersbutton.png" width="130" height="30" />) 
at the bottom of the popup box.</p>

<h3 id="searchingteachers">Using the Search Feature to Display a Subset of Teachers</h3>

<p>If you would like to locate a single teacher record or set of teacher records, you can use the search box at the top right 
of the screen, as shown in this sample search for teachers with the name "Green":</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teacherssearchdemo.png" width="680" height="429" /></div>

<p>To clear the search and return to the full list of teachers, click the <b>Clear Search</b> link directly below 
the search box.</p>

<p>The drop-down menu to the right of the search box can be used to retrieve deleted teachers and teachers who have resigned 
in your search. To include these records, click the relevant boxes before running the search. Note that a search with these 
boxes selected will only <i>add</i> deleted and resigned teachers to your search results, rather than returning <i>only</i> 
those records marked as deleted or resigned.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/deletedresignedsearch.png" width="680" height="322" /></div>

<p>Click the red <b>Search</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/redsearchbutton.png" width="87" height="30" />) to run the search and
locate the records you wish to retrieve.</p>

<h3 id="modifyingteachers">Modifying Page Display to Change Number of Rows Per Page</h3>

<p>The number of teachers displayed on the screen may be set and/or customized by clicking on this icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/tableviewicon.jpg" width="32" height="30" />) in the very last row 
in the table. This reveals the following selection menu:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/tableviewmenu.jpg" width="141" height="204" /></div>

<p>As indicated, the default setting is to display 10 rows on the screen; additional rows will then be shown 
on subsequent screens. You may change this to enable viewing of 25, 50, or 100 column categories at a time. The number of rows can also be 
customized by selecting the <b>Custom</b> selection, in which case you will be prompted to fill in the desired number of rows to be 
made visible per page by the following popup box:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/customrows.jpg" width="534" height="213" /></div>

<p>Enter the desired number of rows to display and click on the <b>OK</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/okbutton.jpg" width="69" height="30" />) 
to save your preference.</p>

<p>Finally, to restore the selection to the default, select <b>Clear Preferences</b> from the selection menu. This will erase any prior 
selection you may have made and revert to the default view of the <b>Teachers</b> page.</p>


<h2 id="invitingteachers">Inviting Teachers to QuickSchools</h2>

<p>If you have imported teachers through Excel or have not checked the <b>Invite via Email</b> box on a manual add, new teachers 
will display an <b>Invite Now</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/invitenowbutton.png" width="94" height="30" />) 
under Invitation Status on the main page:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/invite.png" width="680" height="502" /></div>

<p>Clicking on <b>Invite Now</b> (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/invitenowbutton.png" width="94" height="30" />) will bring up a popup 
box will appear with the teacher’s name and email address and a red <b>Invite</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/redinvitebutton.png" width="83" height="30" />) at the bottom.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/inviteteacherpopup.png" width="561" height="275"/></div>

<p>Clicking <b>Invite</b> (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/redinvitebutton.png" width="83" height="30" />) will send an email to the 
teacher with a link to the school's QuickSchools site, and a password inviting them to log in (as shown in the sample below):</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/emailinvitetext.png" width="680" height="351" /></div>

The teacher's <b>Invitation Status</b> on the main page will then automatically be changed to <b>Invited</b>, and after 
he or she logs in for the first time, the status will change to <b>Active.</b></p>

<h2 id="editingteachers">Editing Teacher Records</h2>

<p>To view and edit an individual teacher record, click on the desired row on the main <b>Teachers</b> page. This 
will bring up the long view of the record, as shown below:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/sampleteacherrecord.png" width="680" height="641" /></div>

<p>Now you can <a href="#uploadteacherphoto"><b>add a photo</b></a>, delete or mark the teacher as resigned, re-invite the teacher 
if not yet active, and edit fields containing biographical/employment information, contact information, and degree/certification information.</p>

<h3 id="uploadteacherphoto">Uploading a Photo</h3>

<div class="left"><img src="images_ks_teachers/uploadteacherphoto.png" width="331" height="468" /></div>
<p>Adding a photo to a teacher record is easy! You can either drag and drop the image onto the photo box, or
click on the <b>Upload Photo</b> button  (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/uploadphoto.png" width="106" height="30" />) and 
select the image from your hard drive.</p>
<p>Then click on the red <b>Save</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/savebutton.png" width="97" height="30" />) 
to associate the image with the student record.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/samplephoto1.png" width="327" height="340" /></div>

<p>The image should appear in the photo box, and also as a thumbnail on the centralized list of records on 
the <b>Teachers</b> page.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teacherthumbnail.png" width="680" height="440" /></div>

<h3 id="teacherstatus">Changing Teacher Status</h3>

<p>Whereas teacher records may be selected for deletion on the main Teachers page, many other modifications to a teacher's 
status may be made from inside the record through the gray dropdown <b>Actions</b> menu.
First, check the teacher's current status, which is listed at the top of the record in the upper box, to the left of the <b>Actions</b>
 menu. Then scroll over the menu header to display your choices.</p>
 
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teacheractionsmenu.png" width="454" height="373" /></div>

<p>You may <b>delete the record</b>, mark the teacher as <b>having resigned</b>, <b>re-invite the teacher</b>, or <b>deactive the teacher's login</b>. 
Once selected, this will change the status listed to the left of the <b>Actions</b> menu. Deleted teachers can also be 
restored to active status through this menu.</p>

<p>If you mark a teacher for resignation, a popup box will appear asking for the resignation date and a comment:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teacherresignpopup.png" width="554" height="243" /></div>

<p>Both fields are required to complete the status change to mark the teacher for resignation. Fill in the date and a comment, 
and click on the red <b>Resign</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/resignbutton.png" width="78" height="30" />) to change 
the teacher's status. You can reinstate resigned teachers using the <b>Actions</b> menu as well.</p>

<p>The <b>Actions</b> menu can also be used to re-invite teachers who have not yet have logged into the QuickSchools account 
for the first time, or to completely de-activate a teacher's login.</p>

<h3 id="editingteacherbio">Editing Biographical and Employee Data</h3>

<p>The upper box of the long view of the teacher record contains both biographical and employee data of use to school 
administrators, including the teacher's preferred name, employee number, date of employment, and social security number:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teacherbiodata.png" width="626" height="315" /></div>

<p>This makes it easy to cross-reference teacher records with payroll and other employee records, enabling quick verification 
of a teacher's identity and correct contact information, displayed in the second box of the teacher record.<p>

<h3 id="editingteachercontact">Editing Contact Information</h3>

<p>The second box of the teacher record contains basic information necessary to contact the teacher by mail, phone, or email:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teachercontactinfo.png" width="652" height="207" /></div>


<h3 id="teacherdegree">Editing Degree and Certificate Information</h3>

<p>The last box of the teacher record provides space for recording the teacher's degree and certification, and a 
field in which relevant experience can be noted:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/degreecertbox.png" width="631" height="227" /></div>

<p>When all information has been entered and updated, don't forget to click the red <b>Save</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/savebutton.png" width="97" height="30" />) to make the desired 
changes permanent. Now you have successfully updated a teacher record!</p>
