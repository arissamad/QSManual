contact information and enabling them to invite new teachers to access QuickSchools via their own unique account login.</p>

two parts, as follows:</h3>

<h2 id="accessingteachers">Accessing the Teachers Tab</h2>
<p>To access the student information tab from your login page, click on the <b>Teachers</b> link in the green 
bar at the top of the screen, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teachaccess.png" /></div>

<p>This will bring up the main Teachers page, on which you will see a list of all teachers in the school. If
you are accessing this page for the very first time, it will appear empty until you add teachers, and the screen will 
display this message:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/teachersfirsttime.png" /></div>

Teachers may be added to the page in two ways: either manually, or by importing teacher records from an 
existing Excel file. Once some teachers have been added, the home page will include a list of those records, presented 
in alphabetical order:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/firstpage.png" /></div>

<p>Add buttons now appear directly above the list of teachers on the main page.</p>

<h2 id="addingteachers">Adding Teachers Manually</h2>

<p>To manually add a teacher, click the <b>Add Teacher</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/addteacherbutton.png" />). This will bring up an <b>Add Teachers</b> popup box 
that looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/addingteacher.png" /></div>

<p>Now you can enter the teacher's full name and email in the corresponding fields in the box. If you would like to sort 
the students by last name, be sure to enter them as [Last Name], [First Name] in the name field; otherwise they will be 
alphabetized by first name. Teachers can be automatically invited to join QuickSchools by checking the <b>Invite via Email</b>
 box. Click the red <b>Add Teacher</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/redaddteacherbutton.png" />) to 
 complete the addition of the teacher record to the Teachers page.</p>

<h2 id="importingteachers">Importing Teacher Records from Excel</h2>

<p>An efficient way to add large numbers of teachers to your QuickSchools account is to use the <b>Import</b>
feature. To do this you need to have your teacher data accessible in an Excel file, one with either an ".xls" or
".xlsx" extension. QuickSchools will automatically analyze your file and map commonly-named columns 
to the fields in a QuickSchools student record.</p>

<p>To proceed, click on the <b>Import</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/importteachbutton.png" />).
This will bring up a file selection screen, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/importscreen1.png" /></div>

<p>Once you select the .xls or .xlsx file containing your teacher data, you will see a second screen 
displaying each set of data from your file and the corresponding field it will be mapped to in the 
QuickSchools database:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/modifyimport.png" /></div>

<p>First, check to make sure that the file you have selected is correct. If not, click on the <b>Change</b> link and 
select the right one. Each field in the .xls or .xlsx file will be mapped to a corresponding field in 
the QuickSchools database. Again, if the choice given is not the best one, you can change it by selecting 
a different one from the drop-down menu. If you want to omit an entire column of data and prevent it from 
being mapped onto a QuickSchools field, place your mouse over the <b>Don't import this column</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/dontimportbutton.png" />) on the right and click it to prevent 
that data set from being uploaded.</p>

<p>When you have made all the necessary changes, scroll down to the bottom of the screen, which should look like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/importdatabutton.png" /></div>

<p>Now click the red button 
<b>Click here to import data</b> (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/redimportbutton.png" />) to initiate the
import. Depending on the size of your file, the process may take a few minutes, during which time you may see either of the 
following popup message boxes:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/processing1.png" /> or <img src="images_ks_teachers/processing2.png" />  </div>

<p>After the import process is complete, your data will be added to your QuickSchools account!</p>

<h2 id="invitingteachers">Inviting Teachers to QuickSchools</h2>

<p>If you have imported teachers through Excel or have not checked the <b>Invite via Email</b> box on a manual add, new teachers 
will display an <b>Invite Now</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/invitenowbutton.png" />) 
under Invitation Status on the main page:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/invite.png" /></div>

<p>Clicking on <b>Invite Now</b> (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/invitenowbutton.png" />) will bring up a popup 
box will appear with the teacherâ€™s name and email address and a red <b>Invite</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/redinvitebutton.png" />) at the bottom.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_teachers/inviteteacherpopup.png" /></div>

<p>Clicking <b>Invite</b> (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_teachers/invitenowbutton.png" />) will send an email to the 
teacher with a password inviting them to log into QuickSchools, and change the <b>Invitation Status</b> on the main page 
to <b>Invited.</b> After the teacher logs in for the first time, the status will change to <b>Active.</b></p>
