<p>Online payments are easy way for your school to manage and collect online credit card payments. QuickSchools uses the online payment service Stripe, so all you need to do is set up an account. Stripe takes care of processing and recording credit card payments, then sends the records right to your QuickSchools account. Once your Stripe account is set up, parents can easily and conveniently pay their bills with their credit cards online right from their QuickSchools Parent Portal.</p> 

<p>This chapter offers detailed information on setting up and managing online payments and setting up and using a Stripe account.</p>

<h2 id="introonlinepayments">Introduction to Online Payments</h2>
<p>Online payments provides a quick and convenient way for parents to submit a credit card payment. Online payments are managed through the Parent Payments page which is accessed through the Student Billing feature. Parents can make credit card payments to your school and view their transactions through their Parent Portal.</p>

<p>Online payments are collected through Stripe, an online payment service. Once your Stripe account is set up, online payments are easy for your school to collect and manage and simple for parents to setup and use.</p>

<h2 id="usingonlinepayments">Using Online Payments</h2>
<p>Online Payments are made through Stripe so there is no need for your school to handle or process credit card payments. Online payments are posted to the Parent Payments page and to student’s individual accounts when parents make their payments from the QuickSchools Parent Portal.</p>

<h2 id="introductionstripe">Introduction to Stripe</h2>
<p>QuickSchools uses the online payment service Stripe to manage all online payments to QuickSchools. To receive online payments, you need to setup a Stripe account. A link to Stripe is available within QuickSchools on the Parent Payments page. Once the school's Stripe account is setup, a View and Pay Fees link will be available in the parent portal menu. When parents click View and Pay Fees, they are prompted to enter their credit card information. Once their credit card information has been entered and saved, parents can quickly pay their fees. Generally, online payments are posted to your school bank account by Stripe 7 days after the payment is made.</p>

<p>QuickSchools charges 4.9% + 30 cents on the total amount paid. For a limited time, we're offering a 3.9% + 30 cents transaction fee for schools who set up Stripe accounts early.</p>






<h3 id="settingupstripe">Setting up a Stripe Account</h3>
<ol>
    <li>From the Student Billing table, click <b>Parent Payments</b>. The Parent Payments page opens.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Connect with Stripe</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    <div class="center">
    <img src="images_ks_fee_tracking/onlinepaymentsconnectstripe.png" width="680" height="293"/>
    </div>
</p>
<ol>
     <p>You are now at the Stripe Website. The Stripe Account Setup page opens.</p>
</ol>
<p>
    <div class="center">
    <img src="images_ks_fee_tracking/stripeaccountsetup.png" width="680" height="542"/>
    </div>
</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Complete the Stripe Account Setup form with your school information.</li>
<li>Click <b>Authorize Access to this Stripe Account</b> when you are finished. Your account is setup and you will return to QuickSchools. You may need to log back in to your QuickSchools account.</li>

</ol>


<h3 id="syncstripe">Synchronizing Stripe Payment Records with QuickSchools</h3> 
<p>Stripe automatically updates your QuickSchools account when online payments are made from the Parent Portal or refunds are issued by your school. These updates usually occur quickly and require no action on your part. However, if a payment or refund is made through the Parent Portal, but your records are not updated immediately, you can synchronize your records with Stripe. This updates your QuickSchools records with the latest payment and refund information that Stripe has recorded.</p>

<p>You can synchronize your QuickSchools account 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <b>Synchronize with Stripe</b> from the Parent Payments page.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<ul>
<li>Click <b>Sync with Stripe</b> from the Online Payment Details dialog box.</li>

</p>


<h3 id="deauthorizetripe">Deauthorizing a Stripe Account</h3>
<p>If you no longer want to receive online payments from parents through Stripe, you can deauthorize  Stripe from accepting payments on your school’s behalf. Deauthorizing Stripe from your QuickSchools account does not close your Stripe account. To close your Stripe account, go to <a href="http://www.stripe.com">Stripe.com</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Parent Payments page, click <b>Disconnect Stripe Account</b>. A confirmation dialog box opens.</li>
