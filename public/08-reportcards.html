<h1>Report Cards</h1>

<p>The <b>Report Cards</b> tab offers school administrators and teachers a convenient, centralized way to activate report 
cards and make them available to students and their families in .pdf format. Report cards can be organized according 
to the comprehensive list of students for the whole school, or by a select number of subjects. In addition, they can be 
customized to reflect different criteria for different subjects.</p>

<h3>A video tutorial giving an overview of the Report Cards section and how to utilize its main features can be viewed in 
two parts, as follows:</h3>

<div class="video">Video link pt.2 coming soon</div>

<p>This chapter offers detailed information about how to configure report card information in QuickSchools. 
Features described include how to set up report cards with different templates for specific subjects, how to view and 
activate report cards so they appear in student records, how to submit final grades on behalf of teachers, 
and how to edit and lock report cycles.</p>

<h2 id="accessingreportcards">Accessing Report Cards Tab</h2>
<p>To access the Report Cards section of QuickSchools from your login page, click on the <b>Report Cards</b> link in the green 
bar at the top of the screen, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardsaccess.png" /></div>

<p>This will bring up the main Report Cards page, on which you will see up to four different menu tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Report Cards</b></li>
<li><b>Subject-Based</b></li>
<li><b>Setup Report Cards</b></li>
<li><b>Setup Subject-Specific Criteria</b> (as shown below)</li>
</ul>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/mainrcardpage.png" /></div>

<p>The main page contains a list of all students in the school. From this page, you can view end-of-year report cards associated with an 
individual student for different terms, download report cards, and activate and deactivate report cards to connect them to student records.</p>

<h2 id="selectingreportcards">Selecting Report Cards</h2>

<p>First, check to see which type of report card (here <b>End-of-Term Report Card</b>) and for which term (here <b>2012/2013, 
Current Semester</b>) the report cards are being listed. This information is located directly below the large red <b>Report Cards</b> 
header on the left side of the page, and may be changed by clicking on the <b>Change</b> link that appears directly to the 
right of the report card type.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardstatus1.png" /></div>

<p>The status line indicating whether or not report cards are editable or locked and read-only appears diretly below the bolded 
type of report card listed at the top of the page. This status may only be changed by users with privileges enabling them 
to have access to managing report cards through the <b>Setup Report Cards</b> tab on this page, as described later in this chapter.</p>

<h3 id="searchingrcards">Search Feature</h3>

<p>The search feature may be used to select a student record, or subset of student records for which you would like to 
see report cards. You may search using the name of the student, or by grade level by entering the numerical grade in the 
search box, as shown in the example below:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/firstgradesearch.png" /></div>

<p>To clear the search and return to the comprehensive list of students, click on the <b>Clear Search</b> link under the 
search box.</p>

<p>Now that your search has returned the records you are interested in, you can view and download a single report card 
by clicking on the appropriate row, or you can select multiple records on the page using the checkboxes to the left, and 
download report cards for all of them simultaneously using the drop-down menu above the checkboxes.</p>
