<h1>Report Cards</h1>

<p>The <b>Report Cards</b> tab offers school administrators and teachers a convenient, centralized way to activate report 
cards and make them available to students and their families in .pdf format. Report cards can be organized according 
to the comprehensive list of students for the whole school, or by a select number of subjects. In addition, they can be 
customized to reflect different criteria for different subjects.</p>

<h3>A video tutorial giving an overview of the Report Cards section and how to utilize its main features can be viewed in 
two parts, as follows:</h3>
<div class="video">Video link coming soon</div>
<div class="video">Video link pt.2 coming soon</div>

<p>This chapter offers detailed information about how to configure report card information in QuickSchools. 
Features described include how to set up report cards with different templates for specific subjects, how to view and 
activate report cards so they appear in student records, how to submit final grades on behalf of teachers, 
and how to edit and lock report cycles.</p>

<h2 id="accessingreportcards">Accessing Report Cards Tab</h2>
<p>To access the Report Cards section of QuickSchools from your login page, click on the <b>Report Cards</b> link in the green 
bar at the top of the screen, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardsaccess.png" /></div>

<p>This will bring up the main Report Cards page, on which you will see up to four different menu tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Report Cards</b></li>
<li><b>Subject-Based</b></li>
<li><b>Setup Report Cards</b></li>
<li><b>Setup Subject-Specific Criteria</b> (as shown below)</li>
</ul>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/mainrcardpage.png" /></div>

<p>The Report Cards tab contains a list of all students in the school. From this page, you can view end-of-year report cards associated with an 
individual student for different terms, download report cards, and activate and deactivate report cards to connect them to student records.</p>

<h2 id="selectingreportcards">Selecting Report Cards</h2>

<p>First, check to see which type of report card (here <b>End-of-Term Report Card</b>) and for which term (here <b>2012/2013, 
Current Semester</b>) the report cards are being listed. This information is located directly below the large red <b>Report Cards</b> 
header on the left side of the page, and may be changed by clicking on the <b>Change</b> link 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/changelink.png" />) that appears directly to the 
right of the report card type.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardstatus1.png" /></div>

<p>The status line indicating whether or not report cards are locked and read-only appears directly below the bolded 
type of report card listed at the top of the page. <i>If the status is not indicated, the report cards are editable.</i>
This status may only be changed by users with privileges enabling them  to have access to managing report cards 
through the <b>Setup Report Cards</b> tab on this page, as described later in this chapter.</p>

<p>Clicking on the <b>Change</b> link (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/changelink.png" />) will bring up a <b>Select Report Session</b> popup box containing a list of all 
    archived course terms, organized chronologically by date of creation:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardsessionselect.png" /></div>

<p>The session currently selected is indicated by the presence of the italicized phrase <i>(Currently viewing this
session)</i> in the <b>Report Session Name</b> column of the popup box. To change this to a different report session, 
just click anywhere on the desired row. The italicized phrase will now move to the selected row automatically.</p>

<p>If your school has many different sessions associated with its account, then repaginating using the table view icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/tableviewicon.jpg" />) may be desirable. For detailed instructions on how
to do this, see the <a href="#modifyingrcards">Modifying Page Display to Change Number of Rows Per Page</a> section of this chapter.
    You may also use the <b>Search</b> feature to locate the session you wish to select.</p>

<p>When you have changed the current session to the one you wish to work on, you may exit the popup box by clicking on 
    the red <b>Cancel</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/cancelbutton.png" />).
</p>

<h2 id="displayingrcards">Displaying and Managing Student Records</h2>

<p>The list of students appearing on the <b>Report Cards</b> tab may be modified <a href="#searchingrcards"></a>using the search feature</a>
to show just a subset of students, displayed in <a href="#reversealpharcards">reverse alphabetical order</a>,
or <a href="#displayingrcards">repaginated to include more records</a> on the page.
</p>

<h3 id="searchingrcards">Search Feature</h3>

<p>The search feature may be used to select a student record, or subset of student records for which you would like to 
see report cards. You may search using the name of the student, or by grade level by entering the numerical grade in the 
search box, as shown in the example below:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/firstgradesearch.png" /></div>

<p>To clear the search and return to the comprehensive list of students, click on the <b>Clear Search</b> link under the 
search box.</p>

<h3 id="reversealpharcards">Displaying Student Records in Reverse Alphabetical Order</h3>

<p>It is easy to display student records in reverse alphabetical order; click once on the dark green border labeled 
<b>Student</b> next to the white triangle and it will reverse to list them from "Z" to "A."</p>

<h3 id="modifyingrcards">Modifying Page Display to Change Number of Rows Per Page</h3>

<p>The number of records displayed on the screen may be set and/or customized by clicking on this icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/tableviewicon.jpg" />) in the very last row 
in the table. This reveals the following selection menu:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/tableviewmenu.jpg" /></div>

<p>As indicated, the default setting is to display 10 rows on the screen; additional rows will then be shown 
on subsequent screens. You may change this to enable viewing of 25, 50, or 100 column categories at a time. The number of rows can also be 
customized to select all records by selecting the <b>Custom</b> selection, in which case you will be prompted 
to fill in the desired number of rows to be made visible per page by the following popup box:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/customrows.jpg" /></div>

<p>Enter the desired number of rows to display and click on the <b>OK</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/okbutton.jpg" />) 
to save your preference.</p>

<p>Finally, to restore the selection to the default, select <b>Clear Preferences</b> from the selection menu. This will erase any prior 
selection you may have made and revert to the default view of the list of records on the <b>Report Cards</b> tab.</p>

<h2 id="downloadingrcards">Editing and Downloading Report Cards</h2>

<p>Now that your display is showing the records you are interested in, you can view, edit and download a single report card 
by clicking on the appropriate row, or you can select multiple records on the page using the checkboxes to the left, and 
download report cards for all of them simultaneously using the drop-down menu above the checkboxes.</p>

<h3 id="singlercard">Viewing, Editing, and Downloading a Single Report Card</h3>

<p>To view a single student record, simply click on the row containing the student name of the record you would like to see.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/singlercard.png" /></div>

<p>This will bring up the report card for the designated student, as shown:</p>
    
    <div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/onercard.png" /></div>
    
<p>If the status of the report cards for that term is not set to locked and read-only, you may edit the attendance, marks, 
    grade, and comment fields. If you just want to view the report card as a .pdf onscreen, or download it to your hard drive, 
   click on the appropriate link at the top right of the screen.</p>
   
 <p>When you have made all the changes necessary to the record, click on the red <b>Save</b> (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/savebutton.png" />) 
 or <b>Save & Close</b> (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/saveclose.png" />) 
 button at the top or bottom of the screen. If you save and close, you will be returned to the main Report Cards screen.
 Alternatively, you can also return to the main screen by clicking on the link <b>Return to List</b> at the top 
 left of the record.
 </p>

<h3 id="multiplercards">Downloading Multiple Report Cards</h3>

<p>From the main Report Cards screen, it is possible to download multiple report card records by using the checkboxes 
on the left side of the page, as shown here:</p>

 <div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardcheckboxes.png" /></div>

<p>Simply select the records you want to include by checking the relevant boxes, and then select <b>Download</b>
 from the drop-down menu. The report cards from the selected records will be compliled 
    in .pdf format and zipped in a single folder marked <b></b>QuickSchools Report Cards</b>. Note that you will 
        only be able to download as many records as appear on the screen. Since the default number of rows is 10, 
        it will be necessary to <a href="#modifyingrcards">change the display</a> to include more records, or even set the display to eliminate 
        pagination altogether and put all records on one page in order to download them all to a single folder in 
        one click. Instructions for how to do this can be found above in the <a href="#modifyingrcards">Modifying Page Display to
        Change Number of Rows Per Page</a> section of this chapter.
    </p>


<h3 id="activatercards">Activating and Deactivating Report Cards</h3>

<p>The column on the far right in the table of listed student records is called <b>Subjects</b>, and when report 
cards are activated for that student, the field contains a list of the subjects in which each student is enrolled. Grades for these subjects will appear on the end-of term 
report card. If deactivated, a reminder message appears to say that the report card is not available in the student 
    record.
</p>

 <div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardactivation.png" /></div>

<p>On the far right of that column is a link to toggle the record to <b>Activate</b> or <b>Deactivate</b>. This enables 
    teachers and administrators to review and edit report cards before activating and making them available to students in the 
    student record.</p>

<h2 id="subjectbased">Subject-Based Grading</h2>

<p>The second tab on the <b>Report Cards</b> main page is the <b>Subject-Based</b> tab, which can be used by administrators 
or teachers to review, edit, and enter grades by subject. This is especially useful for subjects in which there were 
no Gradebook entries or when final grades could not be automatically assessed using conventional Gradebook formulas.</p>

 <div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardssubject.png" /></div>

<h3 id="rcardtype">Selecting Report Card Type and Term</h3>

<p>First, check to see which type of report card (here <b>End-of-Term Report Card</b>) and for which term (here <b>2012/2013, 
Current Semester</b>) the report cards are being listed. This information is located directly below the large red <b>Subject-Based</b> 
header on the left side of the page, and may be changed by clicking on the <b>Change</b> link that appears directly to the 
right of the report card type.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardstatus2.png" /></div>

<p>The status line indicating whether or not report cards are locked and read-only appears directly below the bolded 
type of report card listed at the top of the page. <i>If the status is not indicated, the report cards are editable.</i>
This status may only be changed by users with privileges enabling them  to have access to managing report cards 
through the <b>Setup Report Cards</b> tab on this page, as described later in this chapter.</p>

<p>Clicking on the <b>Change</b> link (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/changelink.png" />) will bring up a <b>Select Report Session</b> popup box containing a list of all 
    archived course terms, organized chronologically by date of creation:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardsessionselect.png" /></div>

<p>The session currently selected is indicated by the presence of the italicized phrase <i>(Currently viewing this
session)</i> in the <b>Report Session Name</b> column of the popup box. To change this to a different report session, 
just click anywhere on the desired row. The italicized phrase will now move to the selected row automatically.</p>

<p>If your school has many different sessions associated with its account, then repaginating using the table view icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/tableviewicon.jpg" />) may be desirable. For detailed instructions on how
to do this, see the <a href="#modifyingrcards">Modifying Page Display to Change Number of Rows Per Page</a> section of this chapter.
    You may also use the <b>Search</b> feature to locate the session you wish to select.</p>

<p>When you have changed the current session to the one you wish to work on, you may exit the popup box by clicking on 
    the red <b>Cancel</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/cancelbutton.png" />).
</p>

<h3 id="rcardteacher">Selecting Teacher and Subject</h3>

<p>Once you have confirmed that the selected report card term and type are correct, the next step is to call up the 
    student records in the course you wish to grade. In <b>Subject-Based</b> grading, this is accomplished by first 
    selecting the name of the teacher on whose behalf you will be grading from the drop-down menu in the gray box at 
    the top of the screen.</p>
    
 <div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardsubjectselect.png" /></div>   

<p>Selecting the teacher will modify the choices of courses available to be selected in the <b>Subject</b> menu, so 
    that only the courses assigned to that teacher will appear. In this way, an administrator or teacher may 
    review and submit grades for the students in a single class taught by the selected teacher. </p>
    
<h3 id = "rcardedit">Reviewing and Editing Grades</h3>

<p>Now that you have selected a teacher and subject, the resulting list of students enrolled in that course will be 
    listed on the main screen of the <b>Subject-Based Grading</b> tab. Note that it is possible to change the display 
    to maximize the <b>Subject-Based Grading</b> window on your screen by clicking on the Maximize icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/maximizebutton.jpg" />), which appears between the red <b>Save</b> 
button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/savebutton.png" />) and the search box at the top 
right-hand corner of the page.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/rcardsubjectgrading.png" /></div>

<p>Existing marks and grades will automatically appear for any student whose grades have been entered into the Gradebook for the 
    course. It is easy to make changes to the <b>Marks</b>, <b>Grade</b>, and <b>Comments</b> fields by simply clicking 
    on the relevant cell you wish to change, as shown in this sample:
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_reportcards/samplesubjectgrading.png" /></div>

<p>The record will automatically indicate a manual change to a student's grade with a red dashed line appearing in the 
<b>Grade</b> box under the new grade. Best practice is to include a comment of explanation as to why the change to the
final grade has been made. When you have finished editing the grade records for the course, remember to click on the 
    red <b>Save</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_reportcards/savebutton.png" />) to permanently record your changes.
