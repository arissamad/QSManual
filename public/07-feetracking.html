<h1 id="feetracking">Fee Tracking</h1>

<p>The Fee Tracking and Student Billing feature enables you to manage student fees and payments. With Fee Tracking, you can keep an up-to-date record for all fees and charges that students owe. You can make personalized lists of common and standard charges, so adding charges to a student's account is done quickly. For a more streamlined billing system, family billing can be enabled so that all students within a family can be viewed together and charged at the same time.</p>

<p>This chapter offers detailed information on managing charges, generating invoices, recording payments, issuing refunds, making personalized lists of charges, and working with family billing.</p>

<h2 id="introfeetracking">Introduction to Fee Tracking</h2>
<p>Fee Tracking begins with the Student Billing table. The Student Billing table shows you a summary of students and account balances. Clicking on a student in the Student Billing table enables you to add, view, and delete charges, generate PDF invoices, and issue refunds.</p>


<h2 id="enabledisablefeetracking">Enabling and Disabling the Fee Tracking Feature</h2>
<p>Like all Features in QuickSchools, you can turn on or turn off a feature and configure access rights and privileges via the Features link near the top right of your screen. This ability is limited to the school admin users.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click <b>Features</b> at the top of the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    <div class="center">
    <img src="images_ks_fee_tracking/features.png" width="680" height="95"/>
    </div>
</p>
<ol>
    <p>The Features page opens.</p>
</ol>
<p>
    <div class="center">
    <img src="images_ks_fee_tracking/featuresfeetrackingenable.png" width="680" height="291"/>
    </div>
</p>
<ol start="2">
    <li>Go to the row that says School Fees Tracking.</li>
    <li>To turn on the Fee Tracking feature, check the checkbox in the School Fees Tracking row.</li>
    <p>The menu bar refreshes. If the Fee Tracking feature is disabled, then the Fee Tracking option will no longer be available in the top menu bar. If the Fee Tracking feature is enabled, then the Fee Tracking option will be available in the top menu bar.</p>
    <li>Click an item from the menu bar to continue. To configure the Fee Tracking feature, see <a href="#settinggeneralfeetrackingpreferences">Setting General Fee Tracking Preferences</a>.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="accessingfeetracking">Accessing the Fee Tracking Page</h2>
<p>To access the Fee Tracking page, click <b>Fee Tracking</b> at the top of the page. If there is no Fee Tracking option at the top of the page, see <a href="#enabledisablefeetracking">Enabling and Disabling the Fee Tracking Feature</a>.</p>
<p>
    <div class="center">
    <img src="images_ks_fee_tracking/accessfeetracking.png" width="680" height="85"/>
    </div>
</p>
<p>The Fee Tracking page opens and the Student Billing table is displayed. The Student Billing table shows a list of students and their outstanding balances.</p>


<h2 id="movingaroundstudentbilling">Moving around the Student Billing Table</h2>
<p>By default, 10 students are displayed on each page of the Student Billing table. When more than 10 students are added, a new page in the Student Billing table is added. Use the navigation controls at the bottom of the Student Billing table to scroll through the pages. To change the number of students shown on each page, see <a href="#studentbillingpreferences">Setting Student Billing Table Preferences</a>.</p>
<p>
    <div class="center">
    <img src="images_ks_fee_tracking/pagenavigationstudentbilling.png" width="680" height="306"/>
    </div>
</p>
<p>Click on a student name (or anywhere in the row) and you'll see the charges and payment details for the students. You can also change how charges are viewed. Select one of the following views:</p>
    <table class="data">
        <tr class="d0"><td>Uninvoiced Charges</td><td>Only shows charges that have not been included in an invoice. Any charges that have been included in an invoice will not be shown in this view.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>All Charges</td><td>Shows all invoiced and uninvoiced charges.</td></tr>
        <tr class="d0"><td>Charges by Invoice</td><td>Shows charges by invoice number and amount.</td></tr>
    </table>
</p>
The invoices in QuickSchools resembles more like a statement of all charges and payments for easy and chronological reference.

<h3 id="generatinginvoices">Generating an Invoice</h3>
<p>You can generate a PDF invoice from a student's account. Invoices in QuickSchools are more closely akin to a credit card statement i.e. both charges and payments are displayed in chronological order for the readers's easy reference. Once the invoice is generated, you can save the file to your computer to be emailed, or you can print a copy to mail. In order to view your PDF invoice, you need to have Adobe Reader installed on your computer. Go to <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe.com</a> for the latest Adobe Reader software.</p>

<p>When you create an invoice, the invoice includes all the charges, payments, and refunds currently displayed in the Uninvoiced Charges tab.</p>

<h2 id="introfeecategories">Introduction to Fee Categories</h2>
<p>Fee Categories are an easy way for you to manage a charge that is used frequently. Categories are templates that enable you to setup and define a fee one time. The categories you define are available in the Add Charge form and can be applied to a student account in one click. When adding new fees to a student's account, you can select several categories at one time, reducing the time it takes to add multiple fees to students' accounts.</p>

<p>Fee Categories are different from Standard Charges in the way they are applied. Fee Categories are applied to a student through the Add Charge dialog box. On the other hand, students are applied to a Standard Charge enabling you to charge one fee to multiple students or the whole school at the same time. For more information about Standard Charges, see <a href="#introstandardcharges">Introduction to Standard Charges</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introstandardcharges">Introduction to Standard Charges </h2>
<p>Standard charges are an easy way for you to group, manage and apply frequently used fees to large groups of students quickly. A Standard Charge is a collection or set of one or more related fees that share a common student base, such as all 1st grade students. After setting up a Standard Charge, simply open the charge you have created and then add students to the charge. You can add students individually, by homerooms, specific grades, or add the entire school with one click. After applying students to the Standard Charge, you can then customize the charge by individual student, if necessary.</p>

<p>For example, all incoming first graders are required to purchase an art kit which includes crayons, clay, and paper. Instead of using the Student Billing table to find and click on each first grade student in the school and then charging each of those students three times for art supplies, a Standard Charge is created called First Grade Art Kit that includes the three art supplies. After the First Grade Art Kit Standard Charge is defined, simply click on the charge to open it, then click All First Graders to add the charge to all first grade students.</p>

<p>Standard Charges are different from Fee Categories in the way they are applied. Students are applied to a Standard Charge enabling you to charge large groups of students at the same time. Fee Categories are applied to a single student through the Add Charge dialog box. For more information about Fee Categories, see <a href="#introfeecategories">Introduction to Fee Categories</a>.</p>

<h2 id="movingaroundfamilybilling">Moving around the Family Billing Table</h2>
<p>When the Family Billing feature is enabled, students are grouped by primary payer in the Student Billing table. You can view accounts by family or by individual student.</p>




<h3 id="viewingfamilyacct">Viewing a Family Account</h3>
<p>From the Student Billing table, click the Primary Payer of the family you want to view.</p>

<p>When viewing a Family Billing account, there are two types of fees displayed in the Description column: individual student fees and fees that include two or more students in a family. Fees that have only been charged to one student will be listed under the description column by the student’s name and a description of the fee. Fees that have been charged to more than one student in the family will be listed as a single entry with the total amount for all charges followed by a link that says Show Items. Click <b>Show Items</b> to display how the charge has been allocated among family members. Click <b>Hide Items</b> to hide the student charges.</p>

<h3 id="settingprimarypayer">Setting the Primary Payer</h3>
<p>Setting the primary payer for students is done from the Students page. Students who do not have a primary payer set will not be visible in the Student Billing table when the Family Billing feature is enabled. When using Family Billing, QuickSchools identifies those students who do not have a primary payer. Click <b> Students have no Primary Payer Set</b> link at the top of the Student Billing table to see a list of students who need to have a primary payer set.</p>

</ol>


<h3 id="addingstudentstofamily">Adding a Student to a Family</h3>
<p>To add a student to a family, simply give the new student the same primary payer as the other members of the family. See see <a href="#settingprimarypayer">Setting the Primary Payer</a> for more information.</p>



<h3 id="editingfamilies">Moving or Deleting a Student from a Family Account</h3>
<p>It is easy to move a student from one family account to another. All you need to do is change the primary payer. Once the student’s primary payer is changed, the student’s name displays in that payer’s family account. For more information, see <a href="#settingprimarypayer">Setting the Primary Payer</a>.</p>

<p>To delete or unassign a student from a family account, you need to change the primary payer. You can change the primary payer so that the student displays in a different family account, or use the Not Selected option, which indicates that no parent or guardian has been identified as being responsible for the student’s school fees. If the Not Selected option is used, then the student will not be visible on the Student Billing page. </p>

<p><b>Tip:</b>To keep students on the Student Billing page even if they don’t have a primary payer, you may want to create an empty or test student account with as many “parents” as you need named “no primary payer,” “scholarship,” “state funded,” or any other appropriate category. You may then assign these categories as a primary payer to students who have special financial arrangements. For more information about adding students, see <a href="#addingstudents">Adding Student Records Manually</a>.</p>

<ol start="4">
    <li>Use the calendar to select the billing date. There are two ways to change the date:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Click the arrowheads on either side of the month and year at the top of the calendar. Clicking the left arrow moves the
            months backwards. Clicking the right arrow moves the months forward. The years move backward or forwards when you reach January.</li>
        <li>Click the arrow next to the month or year. A drop-down menu opens. Click the month or year you want from the drop-down menu. The month and year display on the calendar.</li>
        </ul> 
    <li>Click the number of the day that the charge occurred. The calendar closes.</li>
    <p><b>Note:</b> You can only select a date that occurs after your last generated invoice.</p>
    <li>From the Category drop-down menu, select a Fee Category. The Description and Amount fields automatically update with the preset information. You may edit this information if necessary. This field is optional.</li>
    <p><b>Note:</b> For more information about Fee Categories, see <a href="#introfeecategories">Introduction to Fee Categories</a>. </p>
    <li>In the Description text box, enter more detail about what the fee is for or edit the default Fee Category information. This field is required.</li>
    <li>In the amount text box, enter the total amount being charged to the family. For example, if 4 students in a family are each buying a $10 book, then enter <b>40.00</b>.</li>
    <li>Once you have entered the family total, allocate it among the members of the family in one of these ways:</li>
<table class="data">
        <tr class="d0"><td>Allocate Equally</td><td>Divides the charge equally among all members of the family. In our book example, each of the 4 students is charged $10.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Allocate All</td><td>Applies the entire charge to a single family member. Use this option to charge one student in a family a fee that applies only to them. For example, the first-grade art kit only needs to be applied to the family’s first grader, not to the third- and sixth-grade students in the family.</td></tr>
        <tr class="d0"><td>Custom Entry</td><td>You can manually enter unequal charges to students in a family. For example, a family might owe $100 in total for their 3 students’ pictures. But first-grade, third-grade, and sixth-grade student packages are different prices. You can charge the first-grader $20, the third-grader $35, and the sixth-grader  $45.</td></tr>

<h3 id="deletingchargesfamilybilling">Deleting a Charge from a Family Account</h3>
<p>You can delete a charge from a family account until an invoice is generated for the family. To remove a charge after an invoice has been generated, you will need to issue a refund.

    Refunds
    
    <p> 
       Stripe fees are refunded as well. There are two cases: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Partial Refunded: New Stripe fee is calculated as usual on the new charge amount (ie Previous Amount - Refuned Amount). 
        The fee amount refunded is the old fee - new fee amount.</li>
        <li>Full Refunded: Entire Stripe fee is refunded. (ie 0.00)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        QuickSchools fees are never refunded. The original amount is kept.
    </p>
    <p>
        Right now there is a possible one cent discrepency in the Stripe fee refund amount between what is mentioned in QuickSchools and what is actually refunded.
