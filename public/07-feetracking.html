<h2>Online Payments</h2>

<h3>What appears on the parent's credit card?</h3>
<p>The statement will show the payment as:</p>

<p>[Statement descriptor given to Stripe] [Phone Number] [State]</p>

<p>So, for example, if the statement descriptor in Stripe is set to "THE AMERICAN SCHOOL", and the phone number is "415-111-1111" and the state is "CA", the parent's credit-card statement will show:</p>

<p>THE AMERICAN SCHOOL 4153093715 CA</p>

<p>This allows parents to quickly identify what the payment is for. 
If they have a question they can call the phone number listed instead of disputing the charge via
their credit card company, which will result in chargeback fees for your school.
</p>

<h3>Giving parents refunds</h3>
Any payment made by a parent can be refunded. This action is done within your school's Stripe account.

<ol>
    <li>First, you have to find the Stripe ID for the payment. Look for this in your QuickSchools account, 
    under the Fee Tracking -> Parent Payments menu.</li>
    <li>Once you've found the transaction, click on it to open up the transaction details. Copy the Stripe Payment ID.</li>
    <li>Now log into your school's Stripe account.</li>
    <li>Paste the Stripe Payment ID into the search box in the upper right, and press Enter.</li>
    <li>The transaction should appear. Click on it.</li>
    <li>Now click the Refund Payment button and follow Stripe's instructions.</li>
    <li>Once you're done, go back to your QuickSchools account (the Parent Payments menu.)</li>
    <li>Click Synchronize with Stripe button.</li>
    <li>The refund will now be reflected in QuickSchools as well.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Special Behaviors</h3>

<h3>Refunds</h3>
    <p>
        If a parent's payment should be refunded, this needs to be handled directly within the school's Stripe account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Schools will then have go back to their QS account and sync that payment (either directly or with "Synchonrize with Stripe" 
    if the refund occured in the last 30 days).
    </p>
    <p>
        Once synched, all bill items associated with this online payment should become zero in "Fee Tracking". 
    In the Parents Payment screen, the originally charged amount will still appear, but updated with a red "Refunded" status. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The parent will recieve the full amount back, but the school will still be charged the fees as Stripe does not refund fees.
        (For example, say a parent initially paid $1. The school would recieve $0.65 cents as there are $0.35 in fees. If the school 
        chooses to refund this payment, the parent will recieve his or her $1.00 back and the school will lose $1.00 resulting in a net 
        loss of $0.35 for the school).

    </p>

<h3>Partial Refunds</h3>
    <p>
        If a parent's payment should be partially refunded, this needs to be handled directly within the school's Stripe account.
    </p>
    <p>
         Schools will then have go back to their QS account and sync that payment (either directly or with "Synchonrize with Stripe" 
    if the refund occured in the last 30 days).
    </p>
    <p>
        Once synched, all bill items associated with this online payment should become proportional to the amount refunded. 
    In the Parents Payment screen, the originally charged amount will still appear, but updated with a red "PartiallyRefunded" status. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The parent will recieve the full partial refund amount back, but the school may be charged the fees as Stripe does not refund fees.
        (For example, say a parent initially paid $1. The school would recieve $0.65 cents as there are $0.35 in fees. If the school 
        chooses to partially refund this payment at $0.50, the parent will recieve $0.50 back and the school will lose $0.50 resulting 
        in a $0.15 net total for the school).

    </p>

<h3>Payment Failure</h3>
    <p>
        If a parent's payment should fail, this payment may need to be synced with QuickSchools.
    </p>

    <p>
        If in the school's Stripe account a payment is marked failed, but is marked otherwise on the school's QS account, the school should sync that payment. 
        (Some payments will fail automatically and not require synchronization.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Once synched, all bill items associated with this online payment should become $0.00 in "Fee Tracking". 
    In the Parents Payment screen, the originally charged amount will still appear, but updated with a red "Failed" status. 
    The parent will see an online payment of $0.00.
    </p>
    <p>
       No fees are charged when a payment has failed.

    </p>

<h3>Disputed</h3>
    <p>
        If a parent's payment should be disputed, this needs to be handled directly within the school's Stripe account.
    </p>

    <p>
        Stripe will e-mail the school's Stripe account about the dispute. 
        The amount disputed and a $15 fee will be deducted from the school's Stripe account. 
        The $15 fee is charged regardless of the outcome of the dispute.
    </p>

    </p>

<h3>Family Billing: Surpluses and Deficits</h3>
    <p>
        If a parent has dependents with vary varying amounts of outstanding and surplus bills, it is recommended that the parent pay using "Other Balance" option.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Current balance" sums all dependents balances. If one child owes $50 and another child has a $25 surplus, then the parent may see an intial $25 current balance.
    However, once they click pay now they may see "Current Balance: $50". This is because they owe nothing on the surplus dependent, but still owe $50 on the other dependent.
    Clicking "Other Balance" may make this clearer to the parent.
    </p>
    <p>
     The school can attempt to manage this situation by balancing this surplus in "Fee Tracking" by applying a payment equal to the surplus to the deficit dependent, 
     and applying an equal charge to the surplus dependent. The parent will then only see a $25 bill.
    </p>
     <p>
     In the case where the total balance is $0 or a surplus(and at least one dependent owes), then the parent will be unable to make a payment. 
     The school can attempt to manage this as in the above paragraph.
    </p>
    
<h3>Deauthorize QuickSchools from Stripe</h3>
    <p>
        If the school wishes to deauthorize QuickSchools from Stripe, this is a two step process.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to "Fee Tracking" -> "Parent Payments". Click on "Disconnect Stripe Account". 
        QuickSchools will no longer be able to sync online payments or accept payments for the school.
        <li>Go to Stripe.com. Click "Your Account" -> "Account Settings". You may be prompted for your Stripe password.
        Now navigate to "Applications". You will see "QuickSchools.com". Click on the "X" to deauthorize QuickSchools.
        </li>
    </ol>
