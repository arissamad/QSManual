<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

<p> Welcome to the online manual for QuickSchools, your school management system for K-12 schools! Here you will find 
everything you need to know to understand and navigate all the features QuickSchools has to offer students, parents, 
teachers and administrators. QuickSchools puts all aspects of school-related information at your fingertips, from admissions 
to academics, including attendance, billing and fees, extra-curricular activities, grades, transcripts, and report cards 
for individual students. It is a quick and easy way to facilitate record-keeping and improve communication between 
families, teachers, and administrators in the school, enabling parents to feel more connected and be better informed 
about the educational experience their students are receiving. 

<p> For teachers and administrators, QuickSchools 
streamlines the record-keeping process, providing consistent, school-wide management of grading, attendance, 
fee tracking, and disciplinary action, so that less time can be spent on mundane aspects of administrative 
record-keeping and data collection, and more on putting that information to good use to achieve excellence in education. 
Students can also use QuickSchools to track their educational progress and improve performance, either in a single 
course or throughout their entire school experience. Using QuickSchools, it is easy to see at a glance how students are
doing, what homework is due, and to get feedback directly from teachers on tests, quizzes, and assignments.

<p>This manual is a work-in-progress and we greatly appreciate your input and discussion of what you find presented here.
Eventually, filters on the left-hand side of the page will enable you to customize the manual for your own use as either 
a student, parent, teacher or administrator. Our vision is that the online manual is an evolving document, so there 
will be opportunities for visitors to make comments and provide input on each section as you utilize it. 
In the meantime, feel free to send your feedback to <a href=mailto "support@quickschools.com">support@quickschools.com</a>

<h3>A video tutorial giving a quick overview of the QuickSchools school management system and how to get started using it
can be viewed here:</h3>

<p>The remainder of this introductory chapter will explain how to log in, use the homepage, 
set up your profile, activate features, and configure general settings. Subsequent chapters of this manual give 
more detailed and step-by-step instructions on each feature offered by QuickSchools to help facilitate the administration
of your school.</p>

<h2 id="initiallogin">Logging Into QuickSchools for the First Time</h2>

<p>When you initially set up a QuickSchools account for your school, you are asked to provide a name or abbreviation
for your school that will be used as part of the URL for your own unique QuickSchools site. This unique web address 
is where you will go to log into the QuickSchools site for your school.
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/sitesetup.png" width="680" height="643"/></div>

<p>Once you have reached your QuickSchools site using your unique URL, you may login using the username and password
    you set up when you registered your account.
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/userpass.png" width="480" height="448"/></div>

<h2 id="usinghomepage">Using the Homepage</h2>

<p>Logging in will bring you to your personal home page, displaying the "Teacher's Lounge," as well as a boxed "To Do List," 
and an "Events List." This page functions as a bulletin board where messages may be posted and read, and on which you can
keep track of tasks and scheduled events.
</p>

<h3 id="teacherslounge">Teacher's Lounge</h3>

<p>The Teacher's Lounge is the first thing you will see when you log in to your QuickSchools account. Teachers and administrators 
can leave messages or comments here, which can be seen by everyone with a teacher or administrator account. This makes it easy to 
distribute announcements or discuss policy issues without having to coordinate schedules for a physical meeting of personnel.</p>

<p>Posting a message is as easy as typing into the box at the top of the page and clicking on the <b>Post</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/postbutton.png" width="65" height="30"/>). This will cause it to appear as a 
new entry at the top of the Teacher's Lounge. A file or image can be added by clicking on the "Add photo/file " link, 
    and selecting one from the hard drive. 
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/teacherslounge.png" width="480" height="448"/></div>

<p>You can also easily insert a comment, or add a file or image to an existing comment, by clicking on the relevant link
directly under the comment to which you want to address, as shown above. A comment box will appear and you can type in your 
entry and then click on the <b>Post</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/postbutton.png" width="65" height="30"/>) to add it to the Teacher's Lounge.</p>

<h3 id="todolist">To Do List</h3>

<p>The <b>To Do List</b> is another convenient feature available on the home page after login. It consists of a small 
    dialog box, and functions as a reminder of things you need to accomplish.</p>
    
    <div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/todolist1.png" width="500" height="219"/></div>
    
    <p>To add an item to your <b>To Do List</b>, click on the "+" icon 
    (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/plusicon.png" width="36" height="30"/>) 
at the top right corner of the box. This will 
        automatically insert a line into your box, which you can then overwrite with your desired text to create your
        list item, as shown above. Note that you can easily change the order of items listed in your <b>To Do List</b> by simply 
        clicking on them and dragging them to the desired location inside the box.
    </p>
    
<p>You can check items off your <b>To Do List</b> as you would on any paper checklist, by simply clicking on the box to 
    the left of the item.
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/todolist1.png" width="500" height="200"/></div>

<p>This results in the addition of a strikethrough line, effectively crossing out the item. You may choose to leave the 
    completed item in your <b>To Do List</b>, or you may remove it by clicking on the "Clear Completed" link which appears 
    at the top of the box after an item is checked as completed.
</p>

<h3 id="eventslist">Events List</h3>

<p>The <b>Events List</b> is a great way to keep track of key events occurring in the school. You can add events to your list 
by clicking on the "+" icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/plusicon.png" width="36" height="30"/>) at the top right of the box, and the filter feature lets you sort and display all, upcoming, or 
past events.
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/eventslist.png" width="500" height="289"/></div>

<p>When you click on the "+" icon (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/plusicon.png" width="36" height="30"/>), an 
<b>Add Event</b> popup box will appear, in which you are asked to enter aspects of your event: the date, the name of 
    the event, as well as with whom you wish to share the event (only yourself; all teachers; teachers and parents; or 
    teachers, parents, and students). Anyone you have selected to share the event will automatically find it in their own 
    Events box on login to QuickSchools.
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/addeventpopup.png" width="500" height="371"/></div>

<p>When you have filled out the information, click on the red <b>Add</b> button
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/addbutton.png" width="51" height="30"/>) at the bottom of the box to add the event 
    to your own <b>Events List</b> and the lists of those with whom you have indicated will share the item.
</p>


<h2 id="setprofile">Setting Up Your Profile</h2>

<p>There are two ways to access and edit your QuickSchools profile: you can click on the <b>My Profile</b> link in the dark blue
border at the top of the page, or you can click directly on your user portrait (the image in the top right-hand corner) to get 
to your profile.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/accessprofile.png" width="480" height="169"/></div>

<p> Either method will bring you to your profile page, which looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/profileedit.png" width="500" height="348"/></div>

<p>Although the username you use to log in is not editable, you may change your full name, preferred name, phone contact, 
    and email address on the <b>My Profile</b> page. You can also upload an image to associate with your username by 
    clicking on the <b>Upload Photo</b> button or dragging and dropping an image onto the Profile Picture box.</p>

<p>Don't forget to click on the red <b>Save</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/savebutton.png" width="50" height="30"/>) 
to finalize your profile changes.</p>

<p>You may also opt to change your password you use to login to your QuickSchools account on the <b>My Profile</b> page. 
Just enter the old password, and then the new password (and then a second time to confirm), and click on the red 
<b>Change Password</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/changepassword.png" width="133" height="30"/>) 
to make your change go into effect.</p>

<h2 id="schoolsettings">School Settings</h2>

<p>If you have privileges to edit the settings for your school, you may access the <b>School Settings</b> page by clicking 
    on the link in the dark blue border at the top of the page:
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/schoolsettingsselect.png" width="480" height="162"/></div>

<p>This link will bring you to the <b>School Settings</b> page, which looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/schoolsettings.png" width="500" height="490"/></div>

<p>On this page you can edit the school name, address, phone number, and principal by filling in the appropriate fields 
    and clicking on the red <b>Save</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/savebutton.png" width="50" height="30"/>) 
to finalize your changes.
</p>

<p>As on the profile page, you may also upload or edit the school logo by clicking on the <b>Upload Photo<</b> button, or 
    dragging and dropping an image of the logo onto the image box.
</p>

<p>Finally, you may select which personnel at your school has administrative privileges by clicking in the box and selecting 
    the appropriate names from the drop-down menu. If you wish to add a new role, you can do so by clicking on the green 
    <b>Add a New Role</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/addrolebutton.png" width="126" height="30"/>). 
</p>

<h2 id="activatefeatures">Activating Features</h2>

<p>If you are a school administrator with privileges for activating features and designating who in the school may access 
    different features in various roles, you will see the <b>Features</b> link in the blue border at the top of your page. There 
    are several different features settings that may be changed using this tab, as explained below.
</p>

<h3 id="accessingfeatures">Accessing Features</h3>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/featuresaccess.png" width="500" height="180"/></div>

<p>Clicking on this link will display the features settings that are available to your school account. There are currently 
three different plans available, each of which include different features: the Gaia, Apollo, and Athena plans. </p>

<h3 id="changingplans">Changing Plans</h3>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/changingplans.png" width="650" height="699"/></div>

<p>The plan in which your QuickSchools account is currently enrolled will be clearly marked by colored highlighting and 
the words "You're on the ____ Plan" at the top of the highlighted column (the Apollo Plan is shown as the enrolled one in 
the above example). You can easily upgrade or downgrade your plan by mousing over one of the other two choices and 
clicking on it. The new plan will be highlighted in a different color when you mouse over it (here we have shown the Athena 
plan highlighted in red as an example).
</p>

Clicking on the new plan choice will bring up a confirmation popup box:

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/confirmchangeplan.png" width="500" height="224"/></div>

<p>To change plans, click on the red <b>Change</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/changebutton.png" width="66" height="30"/>)
to confirm your selection.</p>

<h3 id="selectingfeatures">Selecting and Configuring Features</h3>

<p>To turn on features within your plan, click the checkbox corresponding to the feature you want toggled on, and make 
    sure that there is a check in the box indicating that the feature is active.
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_intro/selectfeatures.png" width="500" height="226"/></div>

<p>Additional configuration of features is possible by clicking on the <b>Configure</b> link to the right of each
    checkbox, which will bring up customizable configuration options for the specific feature selected. The content of
    these configurations varies from feature to feature, but often includes setting access privileges for the feature - 
    who may have access to that feature, and what the limits of their access will be.
    These settings are explained in detail in the relevant sections for the given features in subsequent parts of this manual.
</p>

<h2 id="generalsettings">Configuring General Settings</h2>

<p>At the top right of the <b>Features</b> page, you will see an <b>Edit Overall Settings</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/overallsettings.png" width="148" height="30"/>). Clicking on this will 
open a series of menus through which you can make general settings selections for your school's account. These 
include U.S. or U.K.-style configuration, default nationality, selection of personnel with access to new semester setup, 
enabling college-level settings, homeroom name setup, subject enrollment with homeroom grouping, advanced control of 
backup options, and whether or not to display the Teacher's Lounge and the Getting Started page. 
 </p>
<p>As always, don't forget to click on the red <b>Save</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_intro/savebutton.png" width="50" height="30"/>) 
to finalize your overall settings changes before leaving this screen.</p>

<h2 id="managingtermsandsemesters">Managing Terms and Semesters</h2>

<p>Quickschools New Semester Setup enables you to start a new semester or school year from existing QuickSchools databases and information. With the New Semester Setup feature, QuickSchools can automatically promote all current students to the next grade level. This feature not only enables you to promote the entire school in a single click, but all of the students’ historical information, like attendance, grades, billing, and profile information, moves with them.</p>

<p>This same feature can be used mid-year as well when the winter semester ends and the spring semester begins and you want to start a new grading period. Simply create a new semester without promoting the students up a grade. All student schedules and related information is saved.</p>

<p>This feature provides the flexibility and customization you need to accommodate your school's specific grading periods and acadmic year. Grading periods can set up yearly or by semesters or quarters. So that you only have to set up your school's term information once, create and save templates with your semester information, year information, grade promotion structure, homeroom teachers, and start and end dates and apply them easily and quickly to the entire student body year after year.</p>
