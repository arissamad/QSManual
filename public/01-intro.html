<p> Welcome to the online manual for QuickSchools, your school management system for K-12 schools! Here you will find 
everything you need to know to understand and navigate all the features QuickSchools has to offer students, parents, 
teachers and administrators. QuickSchools puts all aspects of school-related information at your fingertips, from admissions 
to academics, including attendance, billing and fees, extra-curricular activities, grades, transcripts, and report cards 
for individual students. It is a quick and easy way to facilitate record-keeping and improve communication between 
families, teachers, and administrators in the school, enabling parents to feel more connected and be better informed 
about the educational experience their students are receiving. 

<p> For teachers and administrators, QuickSchools 
streamlines the record-keeping process, providing consistent, school-wide management of grading, attendance, 
fee tracking, and disciplinary action, so that less time can be spent on mundane aspects of administrative 
record-keeping and data collection, and more on putting that information to good use to achieve excellence in education. 
Students can also use QuickSchools to track their educational progress and improve performance, either in a single 
course or throughout their entire school experience. Using QuickSchools, it is easy to see at a glance how students are
doing, what homework is due, and to get feedback directly from teachers on tests, quizzes, and assignments.

<p>This manual is a work-in-progress and we greatly appreciate your input and discussion of what you find presented here.
Eventually, filters on the left-hand side of the page will enable you to customize the manual for your own use as either 
a student, parent, teacher or administrator. Our vision is that the online manual is an evolving document, so there 
will be opportunities for visitors to make comments and provide input on each section as you utilize it.
