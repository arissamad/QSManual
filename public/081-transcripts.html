<h1 id="transcripts">Transcripts</h1>

<p>The <b>Transcripts</b> tab provides school administrators with a versatile and fully-customizable transcript 
system, enabling them to configure and display transcript records for students in a variety of grade levels, ranging from Kindergarten
to college-bound high school students. Grade point average (GPA) can be calculated using a customizable GPA table, 
establishing a centralized formula that can be used school-wide. Transcripts may be configured to display a 
wide range of information, including student biographical and contact data, attendance, 
subjects taken, grades and credits earned, GPA (both weighted and cumulative), class rank, SAT/ACT scores, and other customizable
fields.</p>

<h3>A video tutorial giving an overview of the Transcripts section and how to utilize its main features can be viewed in 
two parts, as follows:</h3>

<p>This chapter offers detailed information about how to select and configure different kinds of transcripts, 
as well as how to access, view, download, and print student transcripts. Features discussed include basic display and 
access to existing transcripts, configuration of GPA tables, and the use of templates to customize transcripts 
for your school's specific needs.</p>

<h2 id="transfeature">Activating and Configuring Transcripts Feature</h2>

<p>Before getting started with the <b>Transcripts</b> tab, it is necessary to make sure that the Transcripts feature 
    is configured for your QuickSchools account, and to confirm who in your school will have the administrative 
    privileges necessary to access, configure, download, and print student transcripts. You will need to first 
    manage your plan through the <b>Features</b> link to make sure that the Transcripts feature is turned on and 
    that the correct users have the access they need to work with student transcripts.</p>

<p>First, find the <b>Features</b> link in the top header of your QuickSchools screen and click on it. This will bring up
    your school's plan and account page with available features. You must be enrolled in either the Apollo or Athena plan 
    to have access to the Transcripts feature.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_transcripts/features.png" width="680" height="84"/></div>

<p>Make sure that there is a check in the <b>Transcripts</b> row under your plan. This toggles the feature on so
you can work on Transcripts. Then click on the <b>Configure</b> link next to the box to set up Transcripts privileges for 
your school:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_transcripts/configuretrans.png" width="680" height="584"/></div>

<p>This will bring up a <b>Transcripts</b> popup box in which privileges can be set for personnel in your school.
    You can designate who in your school may configure, create, and print transcripts. To do so,
    click in the relevant box and select individual teachers from the drop-down menu, or select <b>All Teachers</b> 
    if you want everyone to be able to access the privilege:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_transcripts/configuretranspopup.png" width="680" height="300" /></div> 

<p>After you have added the personnel you want to have access to these tools, scroll to the bottom of the popup box and 
    click on the red <b>Save</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_transcripts/save.png" width="78" height="30"/>) to register your 
    changes in the system. Now you are ready to access and edit transcripts!</p>

<h2 id="accessingtranscripts">Accessing Transcripts Tab</h2>
<p>To access the Transcript section of QuickSchools from your login page, click on the <b>Transcripts</b> link in the gray 
bar at the top of the screen, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_transcripts/transaccess.png" width="680" height="103"/></div>

<p>This will bring up the main Transcripts page, on which you will see up to three different menu tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Transcripts</b></li>
<li><b>Transcripts Configuration</b></li>
<li><b>Template Selection</b></li>
</ul>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_transcripts/selecttrans.png" width="680" height="360"/></div>

<p>The Transcripts tab contains a list of all students in the school. From this page, you can locate, view,
download, and print individual student transcripts.
</p>

<h2 id="selectingtranscripts">Selecting Transcripts</h2>

<p>Clicking on a student name on the main Transcripts tab will bring up the transcript for that individual, 
    which may then be modified or customized to display different semesters, downloaded, and printed.
