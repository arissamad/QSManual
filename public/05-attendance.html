</p>The <b>Attendance</b> tab makes it easy for teachers, administrators, parents, and students to 
track attendance in three different ways at the school: by <b>Daily Attendance</b>, by <b>Period-Based Attendance</b>,
or by <b>Subject-Based Attendance</b>. Teachers will be able to use the QuickSchools Attendance tab to 
quickly and efficiently take attendance, and attendance data can be easily rolled into a wide variety of different 
attendance reports, which can track attendance by homeroom class, by grade, by period, or by day using Excel spreadsheets.</p>

<h2 id="attendfeatures">Activating and Configuring Attendance Feature and Privileges</h2>

<p>Before getting started with the <b>Attendance</b> tab, it is necessary to make sure that the Attendance feature 
    is configured for your QuickSchools account, and to confirm who in your school will have the administrative 
    privileges necessary to take attendance, configure attendance records, and create attendance reports. 
    You will need to first manage your plan through the <b>Features</b> link to make sure that the Attendance feature 
    is turned on and that the correct users have the access they need to work with attendance rosters and reports.</p>

<p>First, find the <b>Features</b> link in the top header of your QuickSchools screen and click on it. This will bring up
    your school's plan and account page with available features. All three of the QuickSchool plans (Gaia, Apollo, and
    Athena) allow access to the Attendance feature.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/attendfeatures.png" width="680" height="89"/></div>

<p>Make sure that there is a check in the <b>Attendance</b> row under your plan. This toggles the feature on so
you can work on Attendance. Then click on the <b>Configure</b> link next to the box to set up Attendance privileges for 
your school:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/attendfeatures1.png" width="680" height="623"/></div>

<p>This will bring up an <b>Attendance</b> popup box in which privileges can be set for personnel in your school.
    You can designate who in your school may take attendance, who can run attendance reports, and whether or not your 
    school will take attendance more than once a day. For period-based attendance, you can also designate which teachers
    can configure the periods and subjects involved, as shown below:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/attendconfigure.png" width="680" height="555"/></div>

<p><p>After you have added the personnel you want to have access to these tools, scroll to the bottom of the popup box and 
    click on the red <b>Save</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/save.png" width="78" height="30"/>) to register your 
    changes in the system. Now that you have configured the Attendance feature for your school, you are ready to begin taking attendance!</p>

<h2 id="accessingattend">Accessing Attendance Tab</h2>

<p>To access the Attendance section of QuickSchools from your login page, click on the <b>Attendance</b> link in the gray
bar at the top of the screen, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/attendaccess.png" width="680" height="112"/></div>

<p>This will bring up the main Report Cards page, on which you will see three different menu tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Homeroom Attendance</b></li>
<li><b>Subject Attendance</b></li>
<li><b>Attendance Settings</b></li>
</ul>

<p>The default tab is <b>Homeroom Attendance</b>, which loads the page you will need to take 
    attendance in the homeroom. 
</p>

<h2 id="homeroomattend">Homeroom Attendance</h2>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/takeattend.png" width="528" height="375"/></div>

<p>The first time you enter this screen, only the date and the red <b>Take Attendance</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/takeattendbutton.png" width="117" height="30"/>) will be displayed; you must
    click on it in order to load the list of students for the homeroom class you are working on.</p>

<p>To take homeroom attendance, first make sure you are on the <b>Homeroom Attendance</b> page by clicking on the correct tab at the 
    top of the screen. Next, check to see that you have selected the correct teacher name from the drop-down <b>Homeroom:</b> menu on the right-hand side.
    <i>Note that unless you have privileges to take another teacher's homeroom attendance, your selection will be limited to your own name.</i></p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/homeroompage1.png" width="680" height="627"/></div>

<p>Finally, confirm that the date displayed is the one for which you would like to record attendance. The current date will be 
    the default but you can scroll backwards day by day using the arrow to the left of the displayed date.
</p>

<p>The students enrolled in the designated homeroom you have selected will now be displayed, listed by default in a table 
of ten names per screen. This display setting can be easily modified to show more students on a single page, as described below:</p> 

<h3 id="modifyingattend">Modifying Page Display to Change Number of Rows Per Page</h3>

<p>The number of records displayed on the screen may be set and/or customized by clicking on this icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/tableviewicon.png" width="37" height="26"/>) in the very last row 
in the table. This reveals the following selection menu:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/tableviewmenu.png" width="116" height="228"/></div>

<p>As indicated, the default setting is to display 10 rows on the screen; additional rows will then be shown 
on subsequent screens. You may change this to enable viewing of 25, 50, or 100 column categories at a time. The number of rows can also be 
customized to select all records by selecting the <b>Custom</b> selection, in which case you will be prompted 
to fill in the desired number of rows to be made visible per page by the following popup box:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/customrows.png" width="547" height="222"/></div>

<p>Enter the desired number of rows to display and click on the <b>Ok</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/okbutton.png" width="47" height="30"/>) 
to save your preference.</p>

<p>Finally, to restore the selection to the default, select <b>Clear Preferences</b> from the selection menu. This will erase any prior 
selection you may have made and revert to the default view of the list of records on the <b>Homeroom Attendance</b> tab.</p>

<h3 id="takingattend">Taking Homeroom Attendance</h3>

<p>As you can see, students for the designated teacher's homeroom are listed
    alphabetically in the attendance table with categories Present, Absent, Tardy, Tardy with Excuse, Absent with Excuse set up as
    options marked by a radio button selection, as shown:</p>
  
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/homeroompage2.png" width="680" height="525"/></div>

<p>The default setting for all students is <b>Present</b>. To mark a student absent or tardy, and either excused or unexcused, click on 
    the appropriate button under the corresponding column heading for that student.</p>

<p>Additional menu items can be displayed for each student in the class by placing the cursor on the row 
    corresponding to that student. This enables links called <b>Details</b>, <b>Remove</b>, and <b>Add Remark</b> to 
    become available, as described below.</p>

<h3 id="details">Details About Individual Student Attendance Record</h3>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/selectdetails.png" width="680" height="156"/></div>

<p>Clicking on the <b>Details</b> link in a row next to a student's name (remember to mouseover the row to make this 
link visible) brings up a color-coded
    popup box displaying the student's attendance record for the month:
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/details1.png" width="650" height="614"/></div>

<p>The color-coded popup makes it easy to see at a glance to what exent the student has been present, absent, and tardy
in a given month, and whether tardiness and absences were excused or unexcused. Note that the pie chart give statistics
    for the student's attendance record <i>for the whole term</i>, even though only one month of actual attendance 
    is displayed in the calendar. The total number of days of attendance recorded is indicated at the top of the box.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/details2.png" width="680" height="582"/></div>

<p>To change the month displayed, click on the arrow next to the month shown. An individual day of homeroom 
attendance can be reviewed by placing your cursor on the relevant calendar square, which causes an informational
 popup box to appear. This box includes the attendance category saved, the name of the homeroom 
    teacher, and the name of the teacher or administrator who recorded the attendance on that day. To edit the attendance for 
    that day, click on the calendar dates and a new <b>Edit Attendance</b> popup will appear:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/editattendpopup.png" width="415" height="269"/></div>

<p>Attendance status for that day can now be changed by selecting a new status from the drop-down menu. A remark to indicate
    the reason for the change may also be added in the Remark field. Then click the red <b>Update</b> button 
    (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/updatebutton.png" width="64" height="30"/>) to save the changes
    and return to the student detail box.</p>

<p>To exit the detail box and return to the main <b>Homeroom Attendance</b> page, click the red <b>OK</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/redokbutton.png" width="50" height="30"/>) at the bottom
of the popup.</p>

<h3 id="removingattend">Removing Student from Attendance Record</h3>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/selectremove.png" width="680" height="136"/></div>

<p>A student can be removed from the attendance list for a single day, or for multiple days over a period of time, which can 
    be useful if you know a student will not be in school for an extended period.</p>

<p>Clicking on the <b>Remove</b> link in a row next to a student's name (remember to mouseover the row to make this link visible) 
brings up a <b>Confirm Removal</b> popup box that looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/confirmremove.png" width="635" height="261"/></div>

you wish to remove the student from the current day's attendance record. If you would like to remove the student from
more than one day of attendance records, click on the link provided. This will bring up a different <b>Confirm Removal</b>
    popup box allowing you to select removal dates, as shown:
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/confirmmultiple.png" width="642" height="294"/></div>

<p>Choose your "From" and "To" dates and then click on the red <b>Confirm Removal</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/confirmremovebutton.png" width="96" height="30"/>) to confirm that 
you wish to remove the student from the attendance record for those days.</p>

<h3 id="addremark">Adding Remark to Student Attendance Record</h3>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/selectremark.png" width="680" height="170"/></div>

<p>Clicking on the <b>Add Remark</b> link in a row under the Remark column next to a student's name 
(remember to mouseover the row to make this link visible) enables you to type a remark into the box in the 
Remark column. The text will automatically be saved after you enter it.
</p>

<h3 id="clearrefresh">Clear Attendance/Refresh Class List</h3>

<p>To reset aspects of the <b>Homeroom Attendance</b> page, scroll to the bottom right corner and you will see two links:
<b>Clear Attendance</b> and <b>Refresh Class List</b>:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/clearrefresh.png" width="680" height="116"/></div>

<p><b>Clear Attendance</b> can be used in the event that attendance for a given day was erroneously taken and needs to be
reset. <b>Refresh Class List</b> will update the list of students in the homeroom attendance, and can be used to include
students recently enrolled in the class who are not yet appearing on the attendance roster.</p>

<h2 id="subjectattend">Subject Attendance</h2>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/subjectattend1.png" width="680" height="196"/></div>

<p>To access subject-based attendance, click on the <b>Subject Attendance</b> tab at the top of the main 
<b>Attendance</b> screen.</p>

<p>The first time you enter this screen, only the date and the red <b>Take Attendance</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/takeattendbutton.png" width="117" height="30"/>) will be 
displayed; you must click on it in order to choose a subject from an individual teacher's schedule 
and load the list of students enrolled in that class.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/subjectattend.png" width="680" height="215"/></div>

<p>The students enrolled in the first period of the teacher's schedule you have selected will now be displayed, listed by default in a table 
of a maximum of ten names per screen.</p>


<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/subjectstudentlist.png" width="680" height="373"/></div>

<p>This display setting can be easily modified to show more students on a single page, as described below:</p> 

<h3 id="modifyingsubjectattend">Modifying Page Display to Change Number of Rows Per Page</h3>

<p>The number of records displayed on the screen may be set and/or customized by clicking on this icon

<h2 id="attendsettings">Attendance Settings</h2>

<p>On the Attendance Settings page, you can configure the type of attendance for each grade in the school; it can be taken daily, 
by period, or by subject. Note that <i>daily</i> attendance is also called <i>homeroom</i> attendance, and <i>period</i> attendance 
is attendance taken multiple times per day in the homeroom class.
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/attendscreen.png" width="680" height="548"/></div>

<h3 id="setdaily">Setting Daily Attendance</h3>

<p>Selecting Daily Attendance for a grade will leave the default setting in place, enabling the homeroom
teacher for that class to take attendance once per day through the <a href="#homeroomattend"><b>Homeroom Attendance</b></a> tab.
</p>

<h3 id="setperiod">Setting Period-Based Attendance</h3>

<p>Selecting Period-Based Attendance for a grade will open a series of boxes in the settings grid, so that you
can designate how many times per day attendance should be taken by the homeroom teacher. 
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/periodattend.png" width="640" height="333"/></div>

<p>You must enter the number "1" or a greater in the box for each day, regardless of whether or not it is a school day.
Attempting to enter a value of zero or leaving a box blank will result in the following error message:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/oopsvalue.png" width="640" height="314"/></div>

<p>For weekend days and other non-school days, put "1" in the box and simply do not take attendance. Entering a number greater than one will result in the 
appearance of multiple period tabs on the <a href="#homeroomattend"><b>Homeroom Attendance</b></a> page, corresponding to the number of periods entered for that day.
In the above example, the settings indicate that attendance will be taken three times daily on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but
just once a day on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
</p>

<p>Taking attendance on Friday, then, results in the appearance of three period tabs on the <b>Homeroom Attendance</b> page, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/homeroomperiodattend.png" width="600" height="431"/></div>

<p>This is useful when you wish to document partial day absences, or track attendance specifically in one period of the day.</p>

<h3 id="setsubject">Setting Subject-Based Attendance</h3>

<p>Selecting Subject-Based Attendance for a grade will open a series of boxes in the settings grid (similar to what you see 
for Period-Based Attendance), so that you can designate the subjects in which attendance will be taken, and also designate in which 
periods (or how many times per day) attendance should be taken. </p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/setsubject.png" width="640" height="388"/></div>

<p>You must enter the number "1" or a greater in the box for each day, regardless of whether or not it is a school day.
Attempting to enter a value of zero or leaving a box blank will result in the following error message:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/oopsvalue.png" width="640" height="314"/></div>

<p>For weekend days and other non-school days, put "1" in the box and simply do not take attendance. Entering a number greater than one will result in the 
appearance of multiple period tabs on the Subject-Based Attendance page, corresponding to the number of periods entered for that day.
In the above example, the settings indicate that attendance will be taken once daily on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, but
twice a day on Thursdays.
</p>

<p>To configure <b>Subject-Based Attendance,</b> you must click on the <b>Configure</b> link on the right-hand side of the 
    Grade column. This will open a popup box containing a grid corresponding to the days of the week and number of periods 
    selected per day, as shown:
</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/subjecttimetable.png" width="640" height="210"/></div>

<p>Now you can click to configure each school day and period by designating which subjects are being taught, and 
when attendance should be taken. Note that
    multiple subjects can be taught by different teachers in the same period (as shown on Thursday, Period 1), or 
    a subject might extend over multiple periods during which attendance could be taken more than once (as shown
    in the case of History, offered over periods 1-2 on Thursdays).

<p>The <b>Click to configure</b> link brings up a popup box with a list of teachers and courses offered for that grade,
    which then can be designated as subjects in which to take attendance. Placing courses in the box will result in the
    generation of an attendance sheet for that subject in the <b>Subject Attendance</b> tab.

(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/save.png" width="78" height="30"/>)to complete the configuration process and return to the subject time table. Each

    <b>Subject Attendance</b> tab, as described above in the <a href="#takingsubjectattend">Taking Subject Attendance</a> section 
    of this chapter of the manual.
