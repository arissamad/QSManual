</p>The <b>Attendance</b> tab makes it easy for teachers, administrators, parents, and students to 
track attendance in three different ways at the school: by <b>Daily Attendance</b>, by <b>Period-Based Attendance</b>,
or by <b>Subject-Based Attendance</b>. Teachers will be able to use the QuickSchools Attendance tab to 
quickly and efficiently take attendance, and attendance data can be easily rolled into a wide variety of different 
attendance reports, which can track attendance by homeroom class, by grade, by period, or by day using Excel spreadsheets.</p>

<h2 id="attendfeatures">Activating and Configuring Attendance Feature and Privileges</h2>

<p>Before getting started with the <b>Attendance</b> tab, it is necessary to make sure that the Attendance feature 
    is configured for your QuickSchools account, and to confirm who in your school will have the administrative 
    privileges necessary to take attendance, configure attendance records, and create attendance reports. 
    You will need to first manage your plan through the <b>Features</b> link to make sure that the Attendance feature 
    is turned on and that the correct users have the access they need to work with attendance rosters and reports.</p>

<p>First, find the <b>Features</b> link in the top header of your QuickSchools screen and click on it. This will bring up
    your school's plan and account page with available features. All three of the QuickSchool plans (Gaia, Apollo, and
    Athena) allow access to the Attendance feature.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/attendfeatures.png" width="824" height="108"/></div>

<p>Make sure that there is a check in the <b>Attendance</b> row under your plan. This toggles the feature on so
you can work on Attendance. Then click on the <b>Configure</b> link next to the box to set up Attendance privileges for 
your school:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/attendfeatures1.png" width="690" height="632"/></div>

<p>This will bring up an <b>Attendance</b> popup box in which privileges can be set for personnel in your school.
    You can designate who in your school may take attendance, who can run attendance reports, and whether or not your 
    school will take attendance more than once a day. For period-based attendance, you can also designate which teachers
    can configure the periods and subjects involved, as shown below:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/attendconfigure.png" width="694" height="566"/></div>

<p><p>After you have added the personnel you want to have access to these tools, scroll to the bottom of the popup box and 
    click on the red <b>Save</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/save.png" width="78" height="30"/>) to register your 
    changes in the system. Now that you have configured the Attendance feature for your school, you are ready to begin taking attendance!</p>

<h2 id="accessingattend">Accessing Attendance Tab</h2>

<p>To access the Attendance section of QuickSchools from your login page, click on the <b>Attendance</b> link in the gray
bar at the top of the screen, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/attendaccess.png" width="816" height="134"/></div>

<p>This will bring up the main Report Cards page, on which you will see three different menu tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Homeroom Attendance</b></li>
<li><b>Subject Attendance</b></li>
<li><b>Attendance Settings</b></li>
</ul>

<p>The default tab is <b>Homeroom Attendance</b>, which loads the page you will need to take 
    attendance in the homeroom. 
</p>

<h2 id="homeroomattend">Homeroom Attendance</h2>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/takeattend.png" width="528" height="375"/></div>

<p>The first time you enter this screen, only the date and the red <b>Take Attendance</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/takeattendbutton.png" width="117" height="30"/>) will be displayed; you must
    click on it in order to load the list of students for the homeroom class you are working on.</p>

<p>To take homeroom attendance, first make sure you are on the <b>Homeroom Attendance</b> page by clicking on the correct tab at the 
    top of the screen. Next, check to see that you have selected the correct teacher name from the drop-down <b>Homeroom:</b> menu on the right-hand side.
    <i>Note that unless you have privileges to take another teacher's homeroom attendance, your selection will be limited to your own name.</i></p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/homeroompage1.png" width="742" height="684"/></div>

<p>Finally, confirm that the date displayed is the one for which you would like to record attendance. The current date will be 
    the default but you can scroll backwards day by day using the arrow to the left of the displayed date.
</p>

<p>The students enrolled in the designated homeroom you have selected will now be displayed, listed by default in a table 
of ten names per screen. This display setting can be easily modified to show more students on a single page, as described below:</p> 

<h3 id="modifyingattend">Modifying Page Display to Change Number of Rows Per Page</h3>

<p>The number of records displayed on the screen may be set and/or customized by clicking on this icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/tableviewicon.png" width="37" height="26"/>) in the very last row 
in the table. This reveals the following selection menu:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/tableviewmenu.png" width="116" height="228"/></div>

<p>As indicated, the default setting is to display 10 rows on the screen; additional rows will then be shown 
on subsequent screens. You may change this to enable viewing of 25, 50, or 100 column categories at a time. The number of rows can also be 
customized to select all records by selecting the <b>Custom</b> selection, in which case you will be prompted 
to fill in the desired number of rows to be made visible per page by the following popup box:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/customrows.png" width="547" height="222"/></div>

<p>Enter the desired number of rows to display and click on the <b>Ok</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/okbutton.png" width="47" height="30"/>) 
to save your preference.</p>

<p>Finally, to restore the selection to the default, select <b>Clear Preferences</b> from the selection menu. This will erase any prior 
selection you may have made and revert to the default view of the list of records on the <b>Homeroom Attendance</b> tab.</p>

<h3 id="takingattend">Taking Homeroom Attendance</h3>

<p>As you can see, students for the designated teacher's homeroom are listed
    alphabetically in the attendance table with categories Present, Absent, Tardy, Tardy with Excuse, Absent with Excuse set up as
    options marked by a radio button selection, as shown:</p>
  
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/homeroompage2.png" width="719" height="555"/></div>

<p>The default setting for all students is <b>Present</b>. To mark a student absent or tardy, and either excused or unexcused, click on 
    the appropriate button under the corresponding column heading for that student.</p>

<p>Additional menu items can be displayed for each student in the class by placing the cursor on the row 
    corresponding to that student. This enables links called <b>Details</b>, <b>Remove</b>, and <b>Add Remark</b> to 
    become available, as described below.</p>

<h3 id="details">Details About Individual Student Attendance Record</h3>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/selectdetails.png" width="820" height="188"/></div>

<p>Clicking on the <b>Details</b> link in a row next to a student's name (remember to mouseover the row to make this 
link visible) brings up a color-coded
    popup box displaying the student's attendance record for the month:
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/details1.png" width="650" height="614"/></div>

<p>The color-coded popup makes it easy to see at a glance to what exent the student has been present, absent, and tardy
in a given month, and whether tardiness and absences were excused or unexcused. Note that the pie chart give statistics
    for the student's attendance record <i>for the whole term</i>, even though only one month of actual attendance 
    is displayed in the calendar. The total number of days of attendance recorded is indicated at the top of the box.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/details2.png" width="721" height="617"/></div>

<p>To change the month displayed, click on the arrow next to the month shown. An individual day of homeroom 
attendance can be reviewed by placing your cursor on the relevant calendar square, which causes an informational

    teacher, and the name of the teacher or administrator who recorded the attendance on that day. To edit the attendance for 
    that day, click on the calendar dates and a new <b>Edit Attendance</b> popup will appear:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_attendance/editattendpopup.png" width="415" height="269"/></div>

    the reason for the change may also be added in the Remark field. Then click the red <b>Update</b> button 
    (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_attendance/updatebutton.png" width="64" height="30"/>) to save the changes

of a maximum of ten names per screen.</p>
