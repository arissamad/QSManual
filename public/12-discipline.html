<p>The <b>Disciplinary Incidents</b> feature enables teachers and administrators to easily document and track student disciplinary issues.
The incident report form enables teachers and administrators to include detailed information including student name, incident, response, demerit points, and action taken. The Disciplinary Incidents page is linked to the student, teacher, and response databases, so teachers and administrators can get much of an incident report complete with just a few clicks of the mouse. Information within the disciplinary incidents database can be sorted and filtered to find specific students and incidents quickly.</p>

<p><b>Responses</b> are a way to organize incidents into groups for easy management. Use responses to help fairly distribute demerit points and to search for specific disciplinary issues. Responses are an interactive part of Incident reports, so faculty can categorize an incident quickly and have demerit points assigned to the student automatically.</p>

<p>This chapter provides detailed information on creating an incident report, managing the response database, and assigning demerit points. Features include adding, editing, sorting, and deleting incidents, and adding and managing responses and demerit points.</p>

<h2 id="introductionincidents">Introduction to Disciplinary Incident Reports</h2>
<p>Disciplinary incident reports are a way for you to keep track of incidents in your school by student, incident type, incident details, and action taken. With integrated student, teacher, and responses databases, you can quickly fill out an incident report and save it to the disciplinary database so others can reference the incident immediately and the appropriate actions taken. An email to the parents can also be composed and sent at the time an incident report is written or edited.</p>

<h2 id="enabledisablediscipline">Enabling and Disabling the Discipline Feature</h2>
<p>By default the Discipline feature comes enabled. If your school does not need to use the Discipline feature, you may turn the feature off. The Discipline option is removed from the top menu bar giving you a customized look and feel. Likewise, if the Discipline option is not visible in the top menu bar, it is easily enabled for immediate use within your school.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click <b>Features</b> at the top of the page.</li>

<h2 id="movingaroundincidents">Moving Around the Incidents Table</h2>
<p>By default, 10 incidents are displayed on each page of the Incidents table. When more than 10 incidents are reported, a new page in the Incidents table is added.

<h3 id="settinggeneraldisciplinepreferences">Setting General Discipline Preferences</h3>
<p>Disciplinary preferences give you control over writing, viewing, and running student disciplinary records. You probably will want some faculty members to have total access to these records, some with only partial access, and maybe even some faculty members with no access to student disiplinary records at all. Disciplinary preferences enable you to define who can view student disciplinary records, who can write disciplinary reports, who can run disciplinary reports, and if parents can view their child's reports.</p>

<h2 id="introductionresponses">Introduction to Responses and Demerit Points</h2>
<p>Responses are a way to group, or categorize, like incidents. Responses are not incident details or actions taken as a result of an incident, but are a general grouping of similar events for the purpose of assigning demerit points and running searches. For example, name calling, teasing, and insults might all be grouped together under a specific response called 'taunting' or a more general group called 'minor.' Responses can be customized for your school's needs and can be very general, like severe, major, moderate, and minor, or very specific, like truancy, fighting, class disruption, or forgetting homework. You can make as few or as many different response types as you want.</p>

<p>When the 'taunting' response was added to the Responses database, it was assigned a demerit point value of 10. The responses database is linked to your Incident reports, so when a faculty member selects 'taunting' as a response to an incident, then 10 demerit points are automatically added to the student's record. The responses database takes the guesswork out of assigning demerit points to students creating a truly fair and impartial system.</p>

 
<h2 id="accessresponses">Accessing the Responses Page</h2>

<h2 id="movingaroundresponses">Moving Around the Response Types Table</h2>
<p>By default, 10 incidents are displayed on each page of the Response table. When more than 10 responses are entered, a new page in the Response table is added. Use the navigation controls at the bottom of the Response table to scroll through the pages. To change the number of responses shown on each page, see <a href="#responsespreferences">Setting Response Table Preferences</a>.</p>
