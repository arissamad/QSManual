<h2 id="accessing">Accessing the Gradebook</h2>

Accessing the <b>Gradebook</b> is easy! Simply click on the <b>Gradebook</b> feature in the green border at the top of the screen.<br><br>
When you do so, the <b>Gradebook</b> page appears as follows:<br><br> <img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradebook.jpg" /><br><br>

It is possible to maximize the <b>Gradebook</b> window by clicking on the Maximize icon, which looks like this: <img src="images_ks_gradebook/maximizebutton.jpg" />
at the top right-hand corner of the page. Now you are ready to add and calculate grades!<br><br>


<h2 id="adding">Adding Grades to the Gradebook</h2><br>

<h3><b>Course Selection</b></h3><br>
First, select the course you wish to work on from the dropdown menu under <b>Subject</b>: <img src="images_ks_gradebook/subject.jpg" /><br>
Enrolled students should appear in the <b>Students</b> column on the left-hand side of the <b>Gradebook</b>.<br><br><br>

<h3><b>Adding Assignment Columns to the Gradebook</b></h3><br>
To add columns of assignments for grade entries, simply click on the <b>Add Column</b> button <img src="images_ks_gradebook/addcolumn.jpg" /><br> or press <i>Ctrl-A</i><br><br>

This will bring up an <b>Add Column</b> popup box that looks like this:<br><br> <center><img src="images_ks_gradebook/addcolumnpopup.jpg" /></center><br>

Name the column and select a <b>Category</b> (such as <b>Assignment, Quiz,</b> or <b>Test</b>) for the item you are grading. 
Total marks for each assignment default to 100, but may be modified to reflect different point totals for individual assignments.<br><br>
Click on the red <b>Add</b> button <img src="images_ks_gradebook/add.jpg" />at the bottom of the box and your column will be ready to accept grade entries!<br><br><br>

<h3><b>Deleting Assignment Columns from the Gradebook</b></h3><br>
To completely delete an entire column from the <b>Gradebook</b>, mouseover the dark green header at the top of the column you wish to remove.
A small red box containing an X will appear on the right-hand side of the header, as shown below:<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/deletecolumnbutton.jpg" /><br>
Clicking on this red box will permanently eliminate the column and its grades from your <b>Gradebook.</b><br><br>

<h3><b>Entering Grades in the Gradebook</b></h3><br><br>

Enter numeric grades for each student by typing directly into the box next to the student's name. Don't forget to click the <b>Save</b> button 
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/savebutton.jpg" /> or press
<i>Ctrl-S</i> to save your grade entries! The <b>Gradebook</b> will automatically calculate the letter grade according to the scale you have set under <b>Gradebook Settings</b>, and
calculate the class average grade for the assignment at the bottom of the column for easy reference, as shown in this sample: 
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/samplecolumn.jpg" /><br><br>
Displaying the class average and letter grades associated with numerical grade entries can be toggled on and off using 
<a href="#editing"><b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b></a>. Non-numeric grade entries can also be made according to the following legend, which also 
appears on the <b>Gradebook</b> home page:<br><br>

<img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradebooklegend.jpg" /><br><br>

The <b>Legend</b> can be customized to include more grading options using the <b>Grading Setup</b> feature in the green bar
at the top of the <b>Gradebook</b> home page.<br><br><br>

<h3><b>Entering Comments about Student Performance</b></h3><br><br>

Comments about each student's performance 
on the assignment may be added by clicking on the comment icon<br> <img src="images_ks_gradebook/commentsbutton.jpg" /><br> in the lower right-hand corner of the scoring box for that student, which appears when you 
mouseover the box.<br><br>

This will bring up an <b>Edit Comments</b> popup box that looks like this:<br><br><center><img src="images_ks_gradebook/commentspopup.jpg" /></center><br>
The <b>Comments</b> box is configured to accept public comments visible to the student and his or her parents, and also private comments 
visible only to teachers. Enter your comments in the appropriate box and click on the red <b>Save Comments</b> button<br> 
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/savecommentsbutton.jpg" /><br> to save your comments and exit the popup box.
<h2 id="editing">Editing Gradebook Settings</h2><br>

To change the grading scale and make other setting changes to the <b>Gradebook</b>, enter the <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> feature by clicking on this icon 
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/settingsbutton.jpg" /><br>
in the upper right-hand corner of the <b>Gradebook</b> screen.<br><br>

This will bring up an <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> popup box that looks like this:<br><br> <center><img src="images_ks_gradebook/settingspopup.jpg" /></center><br>

<h3><b>Editing Display Preferences: Letter Grades and Class Averages</b></h3><br>

You may toggle the display of letter grades and class averages on (or off) by checking the appropriate boxes at the top left of the 
<b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> screen<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/toggledisplay.jpg" /><br><br>
and then clicking on the red <b>Save</b> button<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/savesettings.jpg" /><br><br><br>

<h3><b>Editing Display Preferences: Gradebook Column Order</b></h3><br><br>
The order in which columns appear in the <b>Gradebook</b> can be modified to appear by date, by column name, by category, or you can 
choose to manually configure their layout by selecting the appropriate choice on the <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> screen<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/columnorder.jpg" /><br><br>

and then clicking on the red <b>Save</b> button<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/savesettings.jpg" /><br>
Selecting <b>Manual control</b> enables you to rearrange the order by dragging the columns horizontally into their desired location on 
the main <b>Gradebook</b> screen.<br><br><br>

<h3><b>Creating A New Grading Scale</b></h3><br><br>
If you need different grading scales for different courses or assignments, you can create and name unique scales by clicking on <b>Create New Scale</b> on the <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> popup screen.<br><br>

This will bring up a <b>New Grading Scale</b> popup box that looks like this (here we have filled in the template with a sample scale 
for an Honors class):<br><br> <center><img src="images_ks_gradebook/newscalepopup.jpg" /></center><br><br>

You can name and describe the new grading scale and change the numeric values associated with each letter grade by filling in the fields with new numbers,
and then clicking on the <b>OK</b> button:
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" /><br><br><br>

To add rows to the grading scale (enabling plus and minus grades, for example), simply click on the <b>Add Row</b> button<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/addrow.jpg" /><br>
in the <b>New Grading Scale</b> popup box. The new row will appear at the bottom of the scale, like this:<br><br>
<center><img src="images_ks_gradebook/newrow.jpg" /></center><br><br>

By re-entering values in the table and clicking on the <b>OK</b> button<br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" /><br><br>now we have transformed the new row into a category for an A- grade, as shown below:<br><br>
<center><img src="images_ks_gradebook/updatednewrow.jpg" /></center><br><br><br>

<h3><b>Customizing A New Grading Scale</b></h3><br><br>
If you want to make changes to an existing grading scale, you can also do this from the <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> screen, by 
first selecting the relevant grading scale from the dropdown menu<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/dropdowngradescale.jpg" /><br>
and then clicking on the <b>Customize grade scale</b> link located just under the grade scale box:<br><br>
<center><img src="images_ks_gradebook/customizeoption.jpg" /></center><br><br>
This will bring up an <b>Edit Grading Scale</b> popup box that looks like this:<br><br> <center><img src="images_ks_gradebook/editgradescalepopup.jpg" /></center><br>
You can use this box to make changes to the numeric values for each grade in the scale, to add rows, or even to delete the grading scale entirely by clicking on the 
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/deletegradingscalelink.jpg" />
link on the right-hand side of the box. Be sure to click on the red <b>OK</b> button<br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" /><br>after making modifications to your grading scale in order to save the changes.<br><br>

<h2 id="formulas">Calculating Grades</h2><br>

One of the most time-saving features of the <b>Gradebook</b> is its ability to calculate midterm and final grades. You can set up your <b>Gradebook</b> 
for each class so that each assignment, test, quiz, or other evaluation is appropriately weighted and factors into the calcuation of each 
student's midterm or final grade, which can then be displayed on the <b>Gradebook</b> screen. This allows the student and his or her 
parents to easily see how the student is doing in the class, and also enables them to track a student's 
progress in the course over time. The final grade is automatically transferred to their Report Card as well.<br><br>
<center><img src="images_ks_gradebook/finalgradecolumn.jpg" /></center><br>
Calculated grade columns are easily distinguished from columns of grades for individual evaluations and assignments because they have 
dark blue instead of green headers. The values shown in these blue columns are automatically calculated according to percentages assigned to each
test, quiz, or other form of assignment or evaluation given. Final letter grades are then given based on the selected grading scale for the class.
<br><br><br>
<h3><b>Adding a Formula to Calculate Grades</b></h3><br><br>

To add a formula for grade calculation, simply click on the <b>Add Formula</b> button<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/addformulabutton.jpg" /><br> on the main <b>Gradebook</b> page. 
This will bring up an <b>Add Formula</b> popup box that looks like this:<br><br> <center><img src="images_ks_gradebook/addformulapopup.jpg" /></center><br>

Then fill in the formula name box and check the box to indicate whether or not this is a calcuation of the final grade for the course.
If so, QuickSchools will automatically transfer the calculated final grade to the student's <b>Report Card</b>. For final grade calculations,
you can set the weight factors by percentage to reflect the values in your syllabus.<br><br>

To add weight factors to your grading formula, click on the <b>Add Weight Factor</b> button<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/addweightfactorbutton.jpg" /><br><br>

This will add a gray weight factor box to your grading formula, as shown here:<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/addoneweightfactor.jpg" /><br><br>

You can add additional weight factors to the grading formula as needed, and then assign the desired percentage to each factor by 
checking the box next to the appropriate evaluation (e.g. test, quiz, assignment), then entering a numerical value in the percentage box above
each gray weight factor box, and clicking on the <b>Add</b> button<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/add.jpg" /><br><br>
The percentage total of all weight factors must equal 100, as shown in this example below utilizing three weight factors:<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/threeweightfactors.jpg" /><br><br>
To further customize the grading formula, you may choose to individually select which instruments within the evaluation categories to
count in grade calculation by using the <b>Show Items</b> button<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/showitemsbutton.jpg" /><br>
to reveal them and check the appropriate ones. For example, if you gave three tests but only want to count the last two, you simply check the boxes 
next to those items, as shown here:<br><br>
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/customizeweightfactor.jpg" /><br>
