<h1 id="gb-ks">Gradebook</h1>

<div class="summary"><p>The <b>Gradebook</b> is a secure, simple and convenient way to record and track grades, allowing administrators, teachers, students
and their parents to get a quick and accurate picture of student performance in a given class. Final grades calculated by the Gradebook are automatically 
transferred to the student's report card, transcript, and the parent portal.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/grades.jpg"/>
</div>
<p>This makes it easy to track student progress and prevents possible errors or delays in the administrative transfer of student records.</p> 

</div>
<h3>A video tutorial for teachers giving an overview of the Gradebook and how to utilize its main features can be viewed in 
two parts, as follows:</h3>

<h2 id="accessing">Accessing the Gradebook</h2>

<p>Accessing the Gradebook is easy! Simply click on the <b>Gradebook</b> feature in the green border at the top of the screen.<br><br>
When you do so, the Gradebook page appears as follows:</p>

<p class="comment andy">
[aris] Can Andy show how we would annotate/mark-up the image?
</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradebook.jpg" /></div>

<p>It is possible to maximize the <b>Gradebook</b> window by clicking on the Maximize icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/maximizebutton.jpg" />) at the top right-hand corner of the page. 
Now you are ready to add and calculate grades!</p>

<h2 id="adding">Adding Grades to the Gradebook</h2>

<h3><b>Course Selection</b></h3>
<p>First, select the course you wish to work on from the dropdown menu under <b>Subject</b>:</p> 
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/subject.jpg" /></div>

<p>Enrolled students should appear in the <b>Students</b> column on the left-hand side of the <b>Gradebook</b>.</p>

<h3 id="addingcolumns"><b>Adding Assignment Columns to the Gradebook</b></h3>
<p>To add columns of assignments for grade entries, simply click on the <b>Add Column</b> button
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/addcolumn.jpg" />) or press <i>Ctrl-A</i></p>

<p>This will bring up an <b>Add Column</b> popup box that looks like this:</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images_ks_gradebook/addcolumnpopup.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Name the column and select a <b>Category</b> (such as <b>Assignment, Quiz,</b> or <b>Test</b>) for the item you are grading. 
It is also possible to add new categories if you would like to include different evaluation instruments in your gradebook through the <a href="#gradesetup"><b>Grading Setup</b></a>
link in the green border at the top right-hand corner of the screen. Total marks for each assignment default to 100, but may be modified to reflect different point totals for individual assignments.<br><br>
Click on the red <b>Add</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/add.jpg" />) at the bottom of the box and your column will be ready to accept grade entries!</p>

<h3><b>Entering Grades in the Gradebook</b></h3>

<p>Enter numeric grades for each student by typing directly into the box next to the student's name. Don't forget to click the <b>Save</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/savebutton.jpg" />) or press
<i>Ctrl-S</i> to save your grade entries! The <b>Gradebook</b> will automatically calculate the letter grade according to the scale you have set using either 
<a href="#editing"><b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b></a> or <a href="#gradesetup"><b>Grade Setup</b></a>, and 
calculate the class average grade for the assignment at the bottom of the column for easy reference:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/samplecolumn.jpg" /></div>
<p>Displaying the class average and letter grades associated with numerical grade entries can be toggled on and off using 
<a href="#editing"><b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b></a>, described in more detail below and accessible by clicking the <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/settingsbutton.jpg" />) on the Gradebook home page.</p>

<p><i>Non-numeric grade entries</i> can also be made according to the following <b>Gradebook Code</b> legend, which may be seen and customized by administrators
through the <a href="#gradesetup"><b>Grading Setup</b></a> link in the green bar at the top of the Gradebook home page:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradebooklegend.jpg" /></div>

<p>This legend also appears on the <b>Gradebook</b> home page, directly under the columns of grade entries.</p>


<div class="right"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/deletecolumnbutton.jpg" /></div>
<br>
<h3><b>Deleting Assignment Columns from the Gradebook</b></h3>
<p>To completely delete an entire column from the <b>Gradebook</b>, mouseover the dark green header at the top of the column you wish to remove.
A small red box containing an X will appear on the right-hand side of the header, as shown to the right.</p>
<p>Clicking on this red box will permanently eliminate the column and its grades from your <b>Gradebook.</b></p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h3><b>Entering Comments about Student Performance</b></h3>

<p>Comments about each student's performance on a given assignment may be added by mousing over the relevant score box for that assignment, 
and clicking on the comment icon (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/commenticon.jpg" />) that appears in the lower right-hand corner 
of the scoring box for that student, as shown below.</p>


<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/commentsbutton.jpg" /></div>

<p>This will bring up an <b>Edit Comments</b> popup box that looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/commentspopup.jpg" /></div>

<p>The <b>Comments</b> box is configured to accept public comments visible to the student and his or her parents, and also private comments 
visible only to teachers. Enter your comments in the appropriate box and click on the red <b>Save Comments</b> button
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/savecommentsbutton.jpg" />) to save your comments and exit the popup box.</p>

<h2 id="editing">Editing Gradebook Settings</h2>

<p>To change the grading scale and make other setting changes to the <b>Gradebook</b>, enter the <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> feature 
by clicking on this icon (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/settingsbutton.jpg" />)
in the upper right-hand corner of the <b>Gradebook</b> screen.</p>

<p>This will bring up an <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> popup box that looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/settingspopup.jpg" /></div>

<h3><b>Editing Display Preferences: Letter Grades and Class Averages</b></h3>

<p>You may toggle the display of letter grades and class averages on (or off) by checking the appropriate boxes at the top left of the 
<b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> screen</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/toggledisplay.jpg" /></div>

<p>and then clicking on the red <b>Save</b> button
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/savesettings.jpg" />).</p>

With both the letter grades and class averages toggled on, the Gradebook looks like this:

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/samplegbook1.jpg" /></div>

<p>whereas with only the letter grades toggled on, the bottom row of class averages would not appear:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/samplegbook2.jpg" /></div>

<p>and with only the class averages toggled on, the green rows of letter grades would be omitted:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/samplegbook3.jpg" /></div>

<h3><b>Editing Display Preferences: Gradebook Column Order</b></h3>

<p>The order in which columns appear in the <b>Gradebook</b> can be modified to appear by date, by column name, by category, or you can 
choose to manually configure their layout by selecting the appropriate choice on the <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> screen:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/columnorder1.jpg" /></div>

<p>and then clicking on the red <b>Save</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/savesettings.jpg" />).
Selecting <b>Manual control</b> enables you to rearrange the order by dragging the columns horizontally into their desired location on 
the main <b>Gradebook</b> screen.</p>

<h3><b>Creating A New Grading Scale</b></h3>

<p>Some subjects may have different grading scales. For example, one subject may have 90-100 as an A, and another may have 95-100 as an A. 
If you need different grading scales for different courses or assignments, you can create and name unique scales
by clicking on <b>Create New Scale</b> on the <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> popup screen.</p>

<p>This will bring up a <b>New Grading Scale</b> popup box that looks like this (here we have filled in the template with a sample scale 
for an Honors class):</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/newscalepopup.jpg" /></div>

<p>You can name and describe the new grading scale and change the numeric values associated with each letter grade by filling in the fields with new numbers,
and then clicking on the <b>OK</b> button
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />)</p>

<p>To add rows to the grading scale (enabling plus and minus grades, for example), simply click on the <b>Add Row</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/addrow.jpg" />)
in the <b>New Grading Scale</b> popup box. The new row will appear at the bottom of the scale, like this:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/newrow.jpg" /></div>

<p>By re-entering values in the table and clicking on the <b>OK</b> button
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />) now we have transformed the new row into a category for an A- grade, as shown below:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/updatednewrow.jpg" /></div>

<h3><b>Customizing A New Grading Scale</b></h3>

<p>If you want to make changes to an existing grading scale, you can also do this from the <b>Edit Gradebook Settings</b> screen, by 
first selecting the relevant grading scale from the dropdown menu</p>
<div class="left"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/dropdowngradescale.jpg" /></div>
<p>and then clicking on the <b>Customize this scale</b> link located just under the grade scale box:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/customizeoption.jpg" /></div>

<p>This will bring up an <b>Edit Grading Scale</b> popup box that looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/editgradescalepopup.jpg" /></div>
<p>You can use this box to make changes to the numeric values for each grade in the scale, to add rows, or even to delete the grading scale entirely by clicking on the 
(<img class="inline"  src="images_ks_gradebook/deletegradingscalelink.jpg" />)
link on the right-hand side of the box. Be sure to click on the red <b>Ok</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />) after making modifications to your grading scale in order to save the changes.</p>

<h2 id="formulas">Calculating Grades</h2>

<p>One of the most time-saving features of the <b>Gradebook</b> is its ability to calculate midterm and final grades. You can set up your Gradebook 
for each class so that each assignment, test, quiz, or other evaluation is appropriately weighted and factors into the calcuation of each 
student's midterm or final grade, which can then be displayed on the Gradebook screen. For example, a subject's final grade could be made up of
50% assignments, 25% quizzes and 25% tests.</p>

<p>The display of both individual grade columns and calculations of midterm or final grades allows the student and his or her 
parents to easily see how the student is doing in the class, and also enables them to track a student's 
progress in the course over time. The final grade is automatically transferred to their Report Card as well.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/finalgradecolumn.jpg" /></div>

<p>Calculated grade columns are easily distinguished from columns of grades for individual evaluations and assignments because they have 
dark blue instead of green headers. The values shown in these blue columns are automatically calculated according to percentages assigned to each
test, quiz, or other form of assignment or evaluation given. Final letter grades are then given based on the selected grading scale for the class.</p>

<h3><b>Adding a Formula to Calculate Grades</b></h3>

<p>To add a formula for grade calculation, simply click on the <b>Add Formula</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/addformulabutton.jpg" />)  on the main <b>Gradebook</b> page. 
This will bring up an <b>Add Formula</b> popup box that looks like this:</p> 

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/addformulapopup.jpg" /></div>

<p>Then fill in the formula name box and check the box to indicate whether or not this is a calculation of the final grade for the course.
If so, QuickSchools will automatically transfer the calculated final grade to the student's <b>Report Card</b>. For final grade calculations,
you can set the weight factors by percentage to reflect the values in your syllabus.</p>

<p><b>Adding Weight Factors</b></p>

<p>To add weight factors to your grading formula, click on <b>Add Another Weight Factor</b> 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/addweightfactorbutton.jpg" />) </p>

<p>This will add a gray weight factor box to your grading formula, as shown here:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/addoneweightfactor.jpg" /></div>

<p>You can add additional weight factors to the grading formula as needed, and then assign the desired percentage to each factor by 
checking the box next to the appropriate evaluation (e.g. test, quiz, assignment), then entering a numerical value in the percentage box above
each gray weight factor box, and clicking on the <b>Add</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/add.jpg" />)</p>

<p>While you may have as many weight factors as you wish in your grading formula, the percentage total of all weight factors
must equal 100%, as shown in this example below utilizing three weight factors:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/threeweightfactors.jpg" /></div>

<p><b>Deleting Weight Factors</b></p>

<p>To delete weight factors from your grading formula, click the <b>Remove</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/removebutton.jpg" />) 
directly below the gray weight factor box you wish to remove. This will cause it to be permanently deleted from your grading formula.</p>

<p><b>Selection or Deselection of Specific Evaluation Instruments</b></p>

<p>To further customize the grading formula, you may choose to individually select which instruments within the evaluation categories to
count in grade calculation by using the <b>Show Items</b> button
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/showitemsbutton.jpg" />) 
to reveal them and check the appropriate ones. For example, if you gave three tests but only want to count the last two, you simply check the boxes 
next to those items, as shown here:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/customizeweightfactor.jpg" /></div>

<p>Items not checked (in this case Test 1) will then not be counted in the final grade calculation.</p>

<h3><b>Editing a Formula to Calculate Grades</b></h3>

<p>If you have already established a formula for calculating midterm or final grades, but later want to change it, you may edit the existing formula
by clicking on the link in white under its name in the blue column box of the Gradebook:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/editformulalink.jpg" /></div>

<p>This will bring up an <b>Edit Formula</b> popup box that looks like this:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/editformulapopup.jpg" /></div>

<p>You can use this box to <i>add or delete weight factors</i>, <i>modify percentages</i> allotted to the existing weight factors, and/or <i>select or deselect individual 
evaluation instruments</i> using the <b>Show Items</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/showitemsbutton.jpg" />).</p>

<p><b>Adding Weight Factors</b></p>

<p>To add weight factors to your grading formula, click on <b>Add Another Weight Factor</b> 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/addweightfactorbutton.jpg" />) </p>

<p>This will add a gray weight factor box to your grading formula, as shown here:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/addoneweightfactor.jpg" /></div>

<p>After adding a new weight factor box, you must readjust the percentages so that they still total 100 with the new factor included.</p>

<p><b>Deleting Weight Factors</b></p>

<p>To delete weight factors from your grading formula, click the <b>Remove</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/removebutton.jpg" />) 
directly below the gray weight factor box you wish to remove. This will cause it to be permanently deleted from your grading formula. After 
deleting a weight factor box, you must readjust the percentages of the remaining weight factors so that they still total 100%.</p>

<p><b>Modifying Percentages of Weight Factors</b></p>

<p>To change the percentages allotted to each weight factor in your original formula, simply enter new values in the percentage boxes directly over each 
weight factor. However, be sure that the percentage total of all weight factors still equals 100% after making your modifications. 
For example, you could edit the existing final grade formula shown above so that assignments and quizzes were weighted equally at 20%, with tests representing 60% 
of the final grade instead of the 50% originally selected:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/editformulapopup2.jpg" /></div>

<p><b>Selection or Deselection of Specific Evaluation Instruments</b></p>

<p>Another option when editing the grading formula is to individually select (or deselect) instruments within the evaluation categories to
count in grade calculation by using the <b>Show Items</b> button
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/showitemsbutton.jpg" />). In this example, the teacher has edited the grading formula by deselecting
Assign 1, which means that in the new formula, the first assignment will <i>not</i> be counted in grade calculation:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/editformuladeselect.jpg" /></div>

<p>Don't forget that you must click on the red <b>Update</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/updatebutton.jpg" />) at 
the bottom center of the <b>Edit Formula</b> box in order for any of the above desired edits to go into effect.</p>

<h2 id="gradesetup">Grading Setup</h2>

<p>Administrators can easily and conveniently configure <b>Gradebook Settings</b> for the entire school by using the <b>Grading Setup</b> link in the 
upper right-hand portion of the green border at the top of the screen. These settings will be reflected in every teacher's Gradebook.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradebooksettings.jpg" /></div>

<p>Clicking on the <b>Grading Setup</b> link opens the <b>Gradebook Settings</b> page, a centralized location where it is possible to set up standard <i>grading 
categories</i>, <i>grading scales</i>, and non-numerical <i>gradebook codes</i> for all teachers' gradebooks in the school, as well as establish
the <i>number of decimal points</i> to be used by the Gradebook, and <i>how the Gradebook formula behaves</i> or responds to missing or 
incomplete grades.</p>

<p><a href="#categories">Grading Categories</a></p>
<p><a href="#scales">Grading Scales</a></p>
<p><a href="#codes">Gradebook Codes</a></p>
<p><a href="#decimalpoints">Number of Decimal Points</a></p>
<p><a href="#formulabehavior">Gradebook Formula Behavior</a></p>

<h2 id="categories">Grading Categories</h2>

<p>The <b>Grading Categories</b> feature in Gradebook Settings enables administrators to identify and establish appropriate column headings 
for evaluation instruments teachers may select in building their Gradebook. In this example, there are three grading categories (Assignment, Quiz, and 
Test):</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradingcategories.jpg" /></div>

<h3><b>Setting the Default Category</b></h3>

<p>Notice that the current default category is set to "Assignment" - this means that when a teacher builds a Gradebook by adding columns of evaluation
instruments, each one will automatically be listed as an Assignment unless selected otherwise via the drop-down Category menu (see 
<a href="#addingcolumns">Adding Assignment Columns to the Gradebook</a> for more on how this works).</p>

<p>To change the default status of a category, click on the <b>Set Default</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/setdefaultbutton.jpg" />) 
opposite the evaluation instrument you want to be the default. This will effect a global change on all Gradebooks school-wide, so 
that when teachers create new columns, the new default category will be in place. However, it will not modify existing categories in Gradebook 
columns already in use.</p>

<h3><b>Adding a Column Category</b></h3>

<p>To add a new column category to the drop-down menu available to teachers when they are setting up their Gradebook, 
click on the <b>Add Column Category</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/addcolumncategorybutton.jpg" />)</p>

<p>This will bring up an <b>Add Gradebook Category</b> popup box that looks like this:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/addcategorypopup.jpg" /></div>

<p>Type the new category name and a brief description, if desired, in the Description field, as shown here:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/newcategorypopup.jpg" /></div>

<p>Now click the <b>OK</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />) to save the new category and make it 
available to teachers in your school. The change will be reflected in the list of Grading Categories you see on your screen:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/newgradingcategories.jpg" /></div>

<h3><b>Editing a Column Category</b></h3>

<p>To make changes to an existing column category, select the category by mousing over the row you want to remove and clicking on it.
This will bring up the <b>Edit Gradebook Category</b> popup box, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/editgradebookcategorypopup.jpg" /></div>
 
<p>Now you can change the category name and description. Don't forget that you must click on the red <b>OK</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />) at 
the bottom center of the <b>Edit Gradebook Category</b> box in order for any of your desired edits to go into effect.</p>

<h3><b>Deleting a Column Category</b></h3>

<p>To delete an existing column category, you must first select the category by mousing over the row you want to remove and clicking on it.
This will bring up the <b>Edit Gradebook Category</b> popup box, as shown:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/editgradebookcategorypopup.jpg" /></div>

<p>Now click on the <b>Delete Category</b> link (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/deletecategorylink.jpg" />) on the 
right-hand side of the box. A <b>Confirm Delete</b> popup box will immediately appear, which looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/confirmdeletepopup.jpg" /></div>

<p>Click on the <b>Delete</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/deletebutton.jpg" />) to confirm your decision to delete 
the category permanently. You will note that this change does not apply retroactively, meaning that gradebooks already in use containing
this category will not see it (or grades associated with it) disappear.</p>

<h3><b>Configuring Display of Grading Categories Table</b></h3>

<p>The display of the <b>Grading Categories</b> table may be set and/or customized by clicking on this icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/tableviewicon.jpg" />) in the very last row 
in the table. This reveals the following selection menu:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/tableviewmenu.jpg" /></div>

<p>As indicated, the default setting is to display 10 rows on the <b>Grading Categories</b> homepage; additional rows will be shown 
on subsequent screens. You may change this to enable viewing of 25, 50, or 100 column categories at a time. The number of rows can also be 
customized by selecting the <b>Custom</b> selection, in which case you will be prompted to fill in the desired number of rows to be 
made visible per page by the following popup box:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/customrows.jpg" /></div>

<p>Enter the desired number of rows to display and click on the <b>OK</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />) 
to save your preference.</p>

<p>Finally, to restore the selection to the default, select <b>Clear Preferences</b> from the selection menu. This will erase any prior 
selection you may have made and revert to the default view of the <b>Grading Categories</b> table.</p>


<h2 id="scales">Grading Scales</h2>
Each school will have a single default grading scale that will automatically be set as the basis for determining grades in each course, unless 
an alternative grading scale is manually selected for use by an individual teacher in his or her Gradebook. The administrator may 
edit the default grading scale, or create a new scale entirely and set it as the default. There may be many different grading 
scales utilized in each school, but only one may be set as the default. 

<h3><b>Editing the Default Grading Scale</b></h3>
<p>Initially, the <b>Grading Scales</b> section of the <b>Gradebook Settings</b> page will include just one default grading scale, 
as shown:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradingscales.jpg" /></div>

<p>To view and edit the default grading scale, click on the row which has been marked <b>Default</b> in the <b>Default?</b> column. 
This will bring up the <b>Edit Grading Scale</b> popup box, which will show you what numerical grade ranges are assigned 
to each letter grade. These minimum and maximum values for each letter grade can be easily changed by clicking on the relevant boxes,
typing in new values, and then clicking the <b>Ok</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />) to save 
your changes.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/editscale.jpg" /></div>

<p>In addition to changing numerical grade ranges, you can use the <b>Edit Grading Scale</b> box to change the name 
and/or description of the grading scale, to add or delete rows to it, or even to delete the grading scale entirely by clicking on the 
(<img class="inline"  src="images_ks_gradebook/deletegradingscalelink.jpg" />)
link on the right-hand side of the box. Don't forget to 
click on the <b>Ok</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />) to save 
your edits when you have completed them.</p>

<h3><b>Deleting a Grading Scale</b></h3>
To delete a grading scale entirely, select the <b>Delete Grading Scale</b> link on the right side of the <b>Edit Grading Scale</b> box.
A <b>Confirm Delete</b> popup box will 
immediately appear, which looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/confirmgradescaledelete.jpg" /></div>

<p>Click on the <b>Delete</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/deletebutton.jpg" />) to confirm your decision to delete 
the row permanently.</p>

<h3><b>Creating A New Grading Scale</b></h3>

<p>Some subjects may need to use different grading scales. For example, one subject may have 90-100 as an A, and another may have 95-100 as an A. 
If your teachers need different grading scales for different courses or assignments, you can create and name unique scales
by clicking on <b>Add Grading Scale</b> (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/addgradescale.jpg" />) under <b>Grading Scales</b> 
on the <b>Gradebook Settings</b> page, shown here:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradingscales.jpg" /></div>
<p>This will bring up a <b>New Grading Scale</b> popup box that looks like this (here we have filled in the template with a sample
name and description for an Honors class):</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradesetupnewscale.jpg" /></div>

<p>You can name and describe your own new grading scale by filling in the name and description fields with the desired information,
and then clicking on the <b>OK</b> button
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />)</p>

<h3><b>Adding Rows to a Grading Scale</b></h3>

<p>To add rows to the grading scale, simply click on the <b>Add Row</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/addrow.jpg" />)
in the <b>New Grading Scale</b> or <b>Edit Grading Scale</b> popup box, and enter the desired grade range for each letter grade. 
Each new row you add will appear at the bottom of the scale, like this:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/newscaleaddrow.jpg" /></div>

<h3><b>Deleting Rows from a Grading Scale</b></h3>
<p>To delete rows from the grading scale, simply click on the <b>Delete</b> button 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/deletegradescale.jpg" />)
in the <b>New Grading Scale</b> or <b>Edit Grading Scale</b> popup box.</p>

<h3><b>Setting the Default Category</b></h3>

<p>Notice that the initial default is set to a grading scale called "Default" - this means that when a teacher enters numerical grades 
in the Gradebook, the corresponding letter grade will be assigned based on this default scale. The name of the default grading scale can be anything; 
what determines if it is the default scale is its marked status in the <b>Default?</b> category.

<p>To change the default status of a grading scale, click on the <b>Set Default</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/setdefaultbutton.jpg" />) 
opposite the grading scale you want to be the default. This will effect a global change on all Gradebooks school-wide, but will not affect the 
calculation of letter grades for grades already entered if they have previously been set to a different grading scale.</p>

<h3><b>Configuring Display of Grading Scales Table</b></h3>

<p>The display of the <b>Grading Scales</b> table may be set and/or customized by clicking on this icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/tableviewicon.jpg" />) in the very last row 
in the table. This reveals the following selection menu:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/tableviewmenu.jpg" /></div>

<p>As indicated, the default setting is to display 10 rows on the <b>Grading Scales</b> homepage; additional rows will be shown 
on subsequent screens. You may change this to enable viewing of 25, 50, or 100 column categories at a time. The number of rows can also be 
customized by selecting the <b>Custom</b> selection, in which case you will be prompted to fill in the desired number of rows to be 
made visible per page by the following popup box:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/customrows.jpg" /></div>

<p>Enter the desired number of rows to display and click on the <b>OK</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />) 
to save your preference.</p>

<p>Finally, to restore the selection to the default, select <b>Clear Preferences</b> from the selection menu. This will erase any prior 
selection you may have made and revert to the default view of the <b>Grading Scales</b> table.</p>

<h2 id="codes">Gradebook Codes</h2>
<p>The <b>Gradebook Codes</b> table displays non-numeric grade codes that can be entered into the Gradebook, and whether or not they are 
to be counted in the assessment of the final grade. These codes can be used when students are absent, do not submit work, or earn zero 
points on an assignment or test. The initial legend of gradebook codes includes five different circumstances under which a 
numerical grade might not be given ([Leave Blank], 0 (zero), E (excused absence), A (unexcused absence), and I 
(Incomplete), as shown):</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradebookcodes.jpg" /></div>

<p>The first two cases, [Leave Blank] and 0 (zero), may not be modified - blank grades are never counted in grade 
calculation, whereas entered scores of zero always are. All other custom codes may be described and set in accordance 
with school policy.</p>

<h3><b>Adding a Custom Code</b></h3>
<p>To add a new custom code to the <b>Gradebook Codes</b> legend, click on the <b>Add Custom Code</b> 
button (<img class="inline"  src="images_ks_gradebook/addcustomcodebutton.jpg" />). This will bring up an <b>Add Custom
Code</b> popup box, which looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/addcustomcodepopup.jpg" /></div>

<p>It is important to remember that custom grade codes can <i>only</i> be toggled to count as zero or not to count at all,
so they are useful as a record of the circumstances surrounding the student's performance, but cannot be used to award partial 
credit.</p>

<p>In this case, the custom code "L" is added to indicate a late assignment, which will count as zero:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/latecode.jpg" /></div>

<p>Don't forget to click on the red <b>OK</b> button (<img class="inline"  src="images_ks_gradebook/ok.jpg" />) to save 
your preferences</p>

<h3><b>Deleting a Custom Code</b></h3>

<p>To delete a custom code, click on the <b>Delete</b> button 
(<img class="inline"  src="images_ks_gradebook/deletegradescale.jpg" />) at the end of the appropriate row in the <b>Gradebook Codes</b> table.</p>

<h3><b>Editing a Custom Code</b></h3>
<p>To edit an existing custom code, mouseover the row in question and click on it. This will bring up an <b>Edit Custom Code</b> 
popup box, which looks like this:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/editcustomcode.jpg" /></div>

<p>You can then change the name of the code, its description, and/or whether or not it will be counted in the Gradebook. 
Click on the red <b>OK</b> button (<img class="inline"  src="images_ks_gradebook/ok.jpg" />) to save your preferences.</p>

<h3><b>Configuring Display of Grading Codes Table</b></h3>

<p>The display of the <b>Grading Codes</b> table may be set and/or customized by clicking on this icon 
(<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/tableviewicon.jpg" />) in the very last row 
in the table. This reveals the following selection menu:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/tableviewmenu.jpg" /></div>

<p>As indicated, the default setting is to display 10 rows on the <b>Grading Codes</b> homepage; additional rows will be shown 
on subsequent screens. You may change this to enable viewing of 25, 50, or 100 column categories at a time. The number of rows can also be 
customized by selecting the <b>Custom</b> selection, in which case you will be prompted to fill in the desired number of rows to be 
made visible per page by the following popup box:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/customrows.jpg" /></div>

<p>Enter the desired number of rows to display and click on the <b>OK</b> button (<img class="inline" src="images_ks_gradebook/okbutton.jpg" />) 
to save your preference.</p>

<p>Finally, to restore the selection to the default, select <b>Clear Preferences</b> from the selection menu. This will erase any prior 
selection you may have made and revert to the default view of the <b>Grading Codes</b> table.</p>

<h2 id="decimalpoints">Number of Decimal Points</h2>
<p>You may select the number of decimal points to be accepted by the Gradebook in receiving and calculating grades by selecting 
either 0, 1, or 2 from the dropdown menu:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/decimalpoints.jpg" /></div>

<h2 id="formulabehavior">Gradebook Formula Behavior</h2>
<p><b>Gradebook Formula Behavior</b> is a special setting administrators can use to decide how the Gradebook will treat 
a case in which a student has no grades for an entire category of assignment.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="images_ks_gradebook/gradebookformulabehavior.jpg" /></div>

<p>There are two options in the dropdown menu, <b>Show Incomplete</b> and <b>Re-normalize</b>. Selecting <b>Show Incomplete</b> 
results in an I grade for the course, whereas <b>Re-normalize</b> (which is the default setting) effectively removes that category from calculation and 
renormalizes the student's grade to a total of 100% without it. This option is extremely useful for handling cases of students 
with a disability accommodation, for example, who may be excused from a category of evaluation (such as quizzes) but should still receive a 
grade in the course.</p>
